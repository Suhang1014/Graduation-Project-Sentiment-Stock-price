"(Adds background on Google’s and automakers’ self-driving car efforts, Krafcik comments) By Joseph White DETROIT, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google wants to form more partnerships with established automakers and suppliers this year to accelerate its work on self-driving cars, the head of the Google project said on Tuesday. John Krafcik, the newly hired president of the Google self-driving car project, did not mention any automakers by name. However, appearing at a media conference at the Detroit auto show, Krafcik surveyed a room packed with hundreds of auto industry executives and said: “We hope to work with many of you guys.” Google officials have said previously the internet search company does not want to build vehicles, but instead supply the software and mapping to allow a car to safely navigate busy streets and highways. “No one goes this alone,” Krafcik said. “We are going to be partnering more and more and more.” He said he hopes to form more alliances this year. Google has worked with automotive suppliers and contract manufacturers to build a small fleet of prototype self-driving cars - small, light pod-cars that look nothing like the sport utility vehicles and pickups on display at the Detroit show. Google, major global automakers and several auto technology companies such as Delphi Automotive Plc, Continental AG and Mobileye NV are jockeying to define and lead development of vehicles that use machine vision, sophisticated maps and artificial intelligence to take over for error-prone human drivers. Krafcik said he believed partially automating the operation of a car, requiring drivers to take command under certain conditions, can create safety problems, a key point on which Google and most automakers differ. The car “has to shoulder the whole burden,” he said. Most automakers, including General Motors Co, Tesla Motors Inc, Daimler AG, and Nissan Motor Co, are pushing to get cars on the road that allow hands-free driving under certain conditions, but require the driver to take over in more complex situations such as city driving.

Neither Ford nor Fields would comment on speculation that Ford is pursuing some form of alliance with internet leader Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google to collaborate on development of self-driving cars, or what the industry calls autonomous vehicles. Ford is pursuing its own efforts to develop autonomous driving technology, and said last week it would triple the size of its self-driving car test fleet to 30 vehicles. “The technology may be ready before society is,” the chairman said, referring to autonomous cars. As the U.S. No. 2 automaker builds its new mobility and connected vehicle businesses, Ford the chairman said his company may consider new management structures. The automaker’s capital-intensive core business of building cars and trucks operates with different rates of return on investment, and different levels of risk, from investing in rapidly changing technologies or service businesses.  Ford’s previous CEO, Alan Mulally, pushed the automaker to operate as “One Ford,” with executives from different operations meeting weekly to share information and resolve problems. “We’ve managed ourselves well with One Ford,” said the chairman. “We want make sure we do this thoughtfully and not create separate companies that aren’t aligned.” Reporting By Joseph White; Editing by Bill RigbyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Keith BedfordTwitter’s shares, which rose as much as 14 percent on Wednesday, pared some gains and closed up 4.1 percent at $17.38. The stock rose from a record low after unconfirmed chatter about News Corp’s interest in Twitter circulated on Wednesday. The rumors intensified after a CNBC segment, tech website Re/code said. The social media site was evaluated as a takeover target because of the company's shrinking stock price, Re/code said. (on.recode.net/1QeVuHw) In the few months since co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as the chief executive, Twitter has been trying to make the site more engaging. The company said in December it was testing a feature to show ads to people who read tweets without logging in as it tries to monetize non-active users. “Twitter inside a larger organization definitely makes theoretical sense, whether its another internet company or a media company,” Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co Inc analyst James Cakmak said. A News Corp spokesman said there was no truth to the rumors. Twitter already has several high-profile investors. Former Microsoft Corp CEO Steve Ballmer reported a 4 percent stake in October, making him the third-biggest shareholder after Twitter co-founder Evan Williams and Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Twitter has been the subject of takeover rumors in the past, including a fake report attributed to Bloomberg that claimed the company had received an offer to be acquired for $31 billion. (reut.rs/1Qn5AIj) Twitter had received bids from Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc, according to reports. Twitter trades at 28.12 times forward earnings, below its peer median of 36.06. Facebook has a PE of 33.08, while LinkedIn Corp’s is 52.64, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Even though News Corp denied the rumors, I do think this could help investors potentially see some valuations for the stock,” Cakmak added. Up to Tuesday’s close, the stock had fallen nearly 41 percent since Dorsey was named permanent CEO in October.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Google has agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($185 million) in back taxes to Britain, prompting criticism from opposition lawmakers and campaigners who said the “derisory” figure smacked of a “sweetheart deal”. The neon Google sign in the foyer of Google's new Canadian engineering headquarters in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario January 14, 2016. REUTERS/Peter Power Google, now part of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), has been under pressure in recent years over its practice of channeling most profits from European clients through Ireland to Bermuda, where it pays no tax on them. In 2013, the company faced a UK parliamentary inquiry after a Reuters investigation showed the firm employed hundreds of salespeople in Britain despite saying it did not conduct sales in the country, a key plank in its tax arrangements. Google said late on Friday the 130 million pounds would settle a probe by the British tax authority, which had challenged the company’s low tax returns for the years since 2005. It said it had also agreed a basis on which tax in the future would be calculated. “The way multinational companies are taxed has been debated for many years and the international tax system is changing as a result. This settlement reflects that shift,” a Google spokesman said in a statement. The deal comes as governments around the world seek to clamp down on multinational companies shifting profits overseas to reduce their tax bills. EU competition authorities have investigated arrangements used by Amazon (AMZN.O) and a unit of Fiat (FCAU.N) in Luxembourg, Apple (AAPL.O) in Ireland and Starbucks (SBUX.O) in the Netherlands, and may start new probes. British finance minister George Osborne welcomed the deal, saying on Twitter it reflected new rules that he had introduced, but others were less impressed. John McDonnell, finance spokesman for the opposition Labour party, said the tax authorities needed to explain how they had settled on the figure of 130 million pounds, which he described as relatively insignificant. “It looks to me ... that this is relatively trivial in comparison with what should have been made, in fact one analysis has put the rate down to about 3 percent, which I think is derisory,” he told BBC Radio on Saturday. “This looks like another sweetheart deal.” Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at Essex University, agreed. He said that for a company that enjoyed UK turnover of around 24 billion pounds over the period and margins of 30 percent, the settlement represented an effective tax rate in the low single digits for Google. “This is a lousy number and we need to know more,” he said. Richard Murphy, a tax expert who has advised the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on economic policy, said the deal was “a disaster” and that, based on the turnover and margins Google enjoyed, “They should have been paying 200 million pounds a year.” Between 2005 and 2013, Google had UK turnover of 17 billion pounds and its main UK unit reported a tax charge of 52 million pounds, filings showed. In 2014, it had UK revenues of around 4 billion pounds, according to its annual report, but has not yet published its UK tax charge.

"(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Mark Fields is joining IBM’s board of directors as the No. 2 U.S. automaker explores alternative mobility options beyond selling cars and trucks. Mark Fields, President and CEO of Ford, speaks with journalists at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, January 11, 2016. REUTERS/Mark BlinchArmonk, N.Y.-based IBM said on Tuesday that Fields, 55, was elected to join the board starting March 1. “Mark led the highly successful transformation of his company in a competitive industry where technology has driven innovation. He is leading Ford into a future where cars are not only vehicles, but increasingly becoming mobile technology platforms,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. Under Fields, Ford has looked at alternatives to traditional car ownership, including mergers and acquisitions and partnerships. Ford and other automakers are increasingly focused on self-driving cars and the potential disruptive influence autonomous cars may have on future car ownership. They face potential threats from new competitors from Silicon Valley. Ford is exploring alternatives like car-sharing and other options to meet future transportation needs. Ford spokesman Mike Moran said “IBM is a global company with a rich history of innovation and disrupting its business model to deliver results – which is very complementary to what we are doing at Ford. Mark will bring unique insights to IBM, and his experience and new relationships serving on the IBM board will bring equal benefits back to Ford.” Fields briefly worked at IBM in sales and marketing after graduating from Rutgers and before attending Harvard Business School. Fields told Reuters earlier this month the automaker is exploring various options to boost its move into car-sharing, self-driving technology and services built on staying connected with customers during the 900 or so hours a year they are behind the wheel. The company has repeatedly declined to comment on reports that Ford is pursuing an alliance with Internet leader Alphabet Inc’s Google to collaborate on development of self-driving cars. Reuters reported in December that the companies have held talks and Fields met with Google co-founder Sergey Brin that same month to discuss the status of the talks. Ford is pursuing its own efforts to develop autonomous driving technology, and said earlier this month it would triple the size of its self-driving car test fleet to 30 vehicles.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google’s secretive drone delivery project could include a component designed to store packages securely. Letters spell the word "Alphabet" as they are seen on a computer screen with a Google search page in this photo illustration taken in Paris, France, August 11, 2015. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol A patent filed Tuesday in the United States by the company, a unit of Alphabet Inc, describes a “delivery receptacle” designed to take packages from an “aerial delivery device” for deposit to a secure location. The receptacle would use infrared beacons to connect with drones in the air and then guide them for delivery. The delivery receptacle would then take the package to a safe location such as a garage, according to the patent. The patent did not provide any details on the nature of the delivery receptacle. A spokesman for the company’s Google X research arm declined comment. The filing provides a glimpse into a plan Google has been exploring since 2012. The project’s leader, Dave Vos, said last November it could start delivering packages by 2017. Dubbed ‘Project Wing’, the initiative was announced in August 2014 with a YouTube video showing a field test conducted in Australia. In the United States, the company has conducted testing with NASA’s AMES Research Center. Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies that are trying to make package delivery by drones a reality. But drone deliveries are not expected to take flight until after the Federal Aviation Administration publishes final rules for commercial drone operations, expected this year. An FAA task force on drones has initiated a system requiring anyone who owns drones heavier than half a pound and lighter than 55 pounds to register before flying outdoors. By early January, 181,061 drones were registered. Vos, who is co-chair of the task force, said during a Consumer Electronics Show workshop earlier this month that existing regulations are sufficient to allow the operation of drones. “I would advocate strongly that the need for additional regulation is very, very small. That in fact, if you allow people to do things and replicate what manned aviation pilots in this airspace do it already works,” he said. “We don’t need new regulation, we need to just be allowed to go do it,” Vos said.

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron leaves Number 10 Downing Street in London, Britain January 27, 2016. REUTERS/Stefan WermuthLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged Cameron to defend the deal, which he said represented a tax rate of just 3 percent on 6 billion pounds ($8.5 billion) of profits that Google, now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, has earned in Britain since 2005. “Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary small businesses and self-employed workers?”, he asked the prime minister in his weekly parliamentary question session. Cameron did not comment on the 130 million-pound settlement, which covers 2005 to 2015 and which brings the company’s total tax bill to around 200 million pounds for the period, during which it had UK revenues of around 24 billion pounds. However, he said he had been genuinely angry over Google’s failure to pay much tax, adding that this largely occurred when Labour was in power from 1997 to 2010. “We’ve done more on tax evasion and tax avoidance than Labour ever did,” he said. Finance minister George Osborne, seen as a possible successor to Cameron, has said the settlement was “a victory for the action we’ve taken” against corporate profit-shifting. Google has said it paid all the tax that was due. It says it declares little profit in the UK because most of its profits are derived from innovations invented in the United States. “We pay tax based on the value added by the economic activity of our staff here,” a Google spokesman said. Profits from European sales are reported in Bermuda, which has a zero tax rate. Domestic media have roundly criticized the tax deal and even vociferous opponents of Corbyn such as the tabloid Sun have backed Labour on the issue. Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc[NWSNA.UL], criticized the deal, tweeting that “Google et al broke no tax laws. Now paying token amounts for p r purposes. Won’t work. Need strong new laws to pay like the rest of us.” His tweets set off a Twitter storm, with others criticizing Murdoch for meetings with the Conservatives, wondering about the taxes paid by Murdoch’s companies, and even referring to some of the reporting tactics at his papers. “Can’t you get some journalists on this instead of hacking celebrities’ phones and the like,” tweeted a user under the handle @tradercoach.

"(Reuters - The Federal Communications Commission plans to propose competition in the pay television set-top box market, a move that could let consumers swap costly cable industry boxes for cheaper service through devices like tablets, according to a document seen by Reuters. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler is announcing the proposed regulation later on Wednesday to let customers get video services from providers like Alphabet Inc, Tivo and Apple instead of cable and satellite companies like Comcast and Dish, according to the proposal, which will be voted on Feb. 18. The FCC says Americans spent $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV cable and satellite boxes, or an average of $231 a year. The summary said set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones have dropped by 90 percent. A coalition of existing pay-TV providers oppose competition in the set-top box market and on Wednesday said it would not provide new programming to customers or lower their television bills. The FCC says consumers should be allowed to get cable TV through an app or through devices like a smart TV or tablet instead of only a set-top box. “The only change the FCC is proposing is to allow consumers alternative means of accessing the content they pay for,” the summary says. The FCC’s goal is to allow consumers to have a user friendly interface that integrates “pay TV and streaming content on one device.” An FCC spokeswoman declined to comment. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association also declined to immediately comment. The FCC summary says a competitive marketplace is required by a 1996 law for service discovery, that tells consumers what programs are available to watch, as well as content delivery and whether the device can record content. The FCC will not propose government specific standards for the three areas but should be open to cable TV rivals using formats that conform “to specifications set by an independent, open standards body.” The FCC proposal also seeks to prevent cable TV companies from using security systems to prevent competition. The FCC says the proposal will ensure copyright protection and have protections for theft of service.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron came under increasing pressure on Wednesday over a back tax deal agreed by Internet group Google that was hailed by his finance minister as a major success but dismissed as “derisory” by the opposition Labour Party. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged Cameron to defend the deal, which he said represented a tax rate of just 3 percent on 6 billion pounds ($8.5 billion) of profits that Google, now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, has earned in Britain since 2005. “Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary small businesses and self-employed workers?”, he asked the prime minister in his weekly parliamentary question session. Cameron did not comment on the 130 million pound settlement which covers 2005 to 2015 and which brings the company’s total tax bill to around 200 million pounds for the period, during which it had UK revenues of around 24 billion pounds. However, he said he had been genuinely angry over Google’s failure to pay much tax, adding that this largely occurred when Labour was in power from 1997 to 2010. “We’ve done more on tax evasion and tax avoidance than Labour ever did,” he said. Finance minister George Osborne, seen as a possible successor to Cameron, has said the settlement was “a victory for the action we’ve taken” against corporate profit-shifting. Google has said it paid all the tax that was due. It says it declares little profit in the UK because most of its profits are derived from innovations invented in the United States. “We pay tax based on the value added by the economic activity of our staff here,” a Google spokesman said. Profits from European sales are reported in Bermuda, which has a zero tax rate. Domestic media have roundly criticized the tax deal and even vociferous opponents of Corbyn such as the tabloid Sun have backed Labour on the issue. Tax avoidance has become a hot political issue in Britain, where people question whether the burden of fixing the public finances has been fairly shared. Since the deal was announced on Friday, Labour has called for an investigation by the National Audit Office, the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has said it will investigate the deal, and the Treasury Committee said it would examine the whole corporation tax system. Google said it was prepared to testify at the PAC hearing, the date for which has yet to be confirmed. (Editing by Hugh Lawson)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google’s secretive drone delivery project could include a component designed to store packages securely. Letters spell the word "Alphabet" as they are seen on a computer screen with a Google search page in this photo illustration taken in Paris, France, August 11, 2015. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol A patent filed Tuesday in the United States by the company, a unit of Alphabet Inc, describes a “delivery receptacle” designed to take packages from an “aerial delivery device” for deposit to a secure location. The receptacle would use infrared beacons to connect with drones in the air and then guide them for delivery. The delivery receptacle would then take the package to a safe location such as a garage, according to the patent. The patent did not provide any details on the nature of the delivery receptacle. A spokesman for the company’s Google X research arm declined comment. The filing provides a glimpse into a plan Google has been exploring since 2012. The project’s leader, Dave Vos, said last November it could start delivering packages by 2017. Dubbed ‘Project Wing’, the initiative was announced in August 2014 with a YouTube video showing a field test conducted in Australia. In the United States, the company has conducted testing with NASA’s AMES Research Center. Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies that are trying to make package delivery by drones a reality. But drone deliveries are not expected to take flight until after the Federal Aviation Administration publishes final rules for commercial drone operations, expected this year. An FAA task force on drones has initiated a system requiring anyone who owns drones heavier than half a pound and lighter than 55 pounds to register before flying outdoors. By early January, 181,061 drones were registered. Vos, who is co-chair of the task force, said during a Consumer Electronics Show workshop earlier this month that existing regulations are sufficient to allow the operation of drones. “I would advocate strongly that the need for additional regulation is very, very small. That in fact, if you allow people to do things and replicate what manned aviation pilots in this airspace do it already works,” he said. “We don’t need new regulation, we need to just be allowed to go do it,” Vos said.

The neon Google sign in the foyer of Google's new Canadian engineering headquarters in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario January 14, 2016. REUTERS/Peter PowerLong accustomed to having their distinctive slang misunderstood, Australians can now substitute “footy” for football, “arvo” for afternoon and find directions to Mullumbimby or Goondiwindi, a spokesman told Reuters on Friday. The extended vocabulary came after Google, which is now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, added an Australian accented voice to its Google Maps and search applications last week. “People are starting to talk to their phones much more regularly now. Mobile voice searchers have doubled in the last year,” Google Australia spokesman Shane Treeves said. “Particularly all those tricky Aussie place names, they just sound much better in an Aussie voice that can get them right.” Google and its chief competitor, Apple Inc, have saturated the United States and Western Europe with their devices, leaving foreign language markets as some of the prime places to grow. In December, Apple released a version of its virtual personal assistant, Siri, for Arabic speakers in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Google’s Android phones’ search function already offered some support in Arabic. Google’s Android operating system was used by roughly 54 percent of mobile devices sold in Australia in December, placing it ahead of Apple iOS at 38 percent, according to data published by research firm Kantar Worldpanel. The addition of Australian language features to Google’s software could carry with it a sense of vindication for local users, who have long groused about its inability to understand them. In 2004, Google bought mapping company Where 2 Technologies, which formed the basis for its hugely popular Google Maps software. The company was based in Sydney.

A Google employee on a bicycle acts as a real-life obstacle for a Google self-driving prototype car to react to during a media preview of Google's prototype autonomous vehicles in Mountain View, California September 29, 2015. REUTERS/Elijah NouvelageInvestors will get their long-awaited answer when Alphabet reports fourth-quarter results after markets close on Monday. The report will be the first time Alphabet will break out results for what it calls “Other Bets,” which includes Google Fiber; smart home accessory maker Nest Labs and the secretive “X”, home to the self-driving cars project. The results will also show how successful Google was in targeting ads at a fast-growing number of mobile users, especially after Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) stellar report. A strong report could boost the stock enough for Alphabet to surpass Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the most valuable company in the world. “For the first time they (Alphabet) have a real catalyst to the stock, aside from a standard beat-and-raise,” said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc. The market has wanted four things from Alphabet: consistent revenue growth, margin stabilization, greater disclosure and share buybacks, and they will get all of them this quarter, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said. The reading may not be pretty. A Raymond James survey showed that 72 percent of investors expect “Other Bets” lost more than $1.5 billion in 2015. “We believe revenues from Other Bets will be fairly immaterial for Alphabet given the early stages of most of these businesses,” Raymond James analysts wrote in a note. To be sure, almost all of Alphabet’s revenue comes from its Google unit. The unit houses its Internet and related businesses such as search, ads, maps, YouTube and Android as well as hardware products such as its Chromebooks. Google’s revenue has been bolstered by its efforts to drive sales from its mobile and video advertising as well as Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat’s increased discipline on expenses.

For the first time, the company disclosed the profitability of Google’s search engine and its other online services, and how much it is spending on ambitious technology projects such as self-driving cars. The numbers were lapped up by investors, who saw room for growth in Google’s traditional business, and were relieved to see that spending on new projects it calls ‘Other Bets’ was not as lavish as some had feared. “It’s pretty interesting that 80 percent of YouTube views come from outside of the United States. I didn’t think it would be that high,” said Kevin Kelly, managing partner at Recon Capital. “It demonstrates that the value of YouTube can continue to be extracted,” he said. The operating profit margin for its Google unit was 31.9 percent in the most recent quarter, compared to 25 percent for Alphabet. Alphabet spent $869 million on capital expenditures for the Other Bets in 2015, up from $501 million in 2014. It has not made any projections about if or when those bets cumulatively would become profitable. “As long as the core business continues to operate well with accelerated revenue... investment in those businesses can continue,” said Ronald Josey of JMP Securities. The company said consolidated revenue jumped 17.8 percent to $21.33 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $18.10 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $20.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue for Other Bets was $151 million, up 29.8 percent from $106 million in the same quarter last year, primarily from its smart-home monitoring unit Nest, Google Fiber, which provides high-speed Internet access, and its life sciences business Verily. Adjusted earnings of $8.67 per share handily beat analysts’ average estimate of $8.10 per share. Related CoverageAlphabet passes Apple to become most valuable traded U.S. companyIn a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat attributed the strong earnings to “increased use of mobile search by consumers,” as well as “ongoing momentum” in YouTube and programmatic advertising, referring to the automatic buying of ads. Kelly at Recon Capital said he would not be surprised if YouTube saw a surge in advertising revenues beyond the 17 percent increase it saw during the 2015 fiscal year. Total operating losses on the Other Bets – which include glucose-monitoring contact lenses and Internet balloons - increased to $3.57 billion in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The Google unit houses its Internet and related businesses such as search, ads, maps, YouTube and Android as well as hardware products such as its low-cost Chromebook laptops. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on the call that its Gmail service crossed one billion monthly active users last quarter, joining Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube and Google Play in topping that mark. He also touted the company’s performance during the holiday shopping season, saying that programmatic video impressions doubled this season compared to last, and that 60 percent of them came from mobile devices. But Porat, without providing figures, said the company planned to accelerate capital expenditures in 2016 compared to the previous year. Google’s shares rose almost 5 percent in after-hours trading. Alphabet’s combined share classes were worth $549 billion, compared with Apple, which had a value of about $534 billion. Alphabet will officially overtake Apple in market value if both companies’ shares open around current levels on Tuesday. Google’s advertising revenue increased nearly 17 percent to $19.08 billion, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 31 percent, the company said.

The two companies’ operating systems and apps are in direct competition with each other and Apple is still in litigation with Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), the biggest Android smartphone maker. Alphabet shares jumped 6 percent on Monday after reporting strong quarterly earnings after the bell, making its combined share classes worth $554 billion, compared with Apple, which had a value of about $534 billion. Apple shares dipped last week after reporting the slowest-ever increase in iPhone shipments and forecasting its first revenue drop in 13 years. Alphabet will officially overtake Apple in market value if the two companies’ shares open around current levels on Tuesday. The Internet powerhouse’s stock has surged in the last year, helped by increasing sales of advertising on mobile devices, while Apple has struggled due to signs of softening demand for its signature phone, especially in China, and the lack of another blockbuster product in its pipeline. “This makes Alphabet an even stronger bellwether for investors to watch,” Scott Fullman, chief strategist at Revere Securities Corp, after the earnings on Monday. “The company has been tracking very well given the volatility in the market, dominated by falling energy prices and weakness from China.” The latest spurt in Alphabet’s stock price growth started around July last year. Since then the company has restructured, forming a new holding company and splitting into two parts. Google includes its search engine, YouTube and related parts of the company, while a unit called ‘Other Bets’ includes its ‘moonshots’ such as self-driving cars, and encompasses Google Capital, the secretive X research division and Nest, which offers smart-home accessories. Investors have appreciated the company’s new discipline on costs, which started with the arrival of new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat. For a time it looked as if Apple would never relinquish the top spot in terms of market value. Bolstered by success of the iPhone, an enormous cash hoard, Apple took over the top U.S. spot in 2012 from Exxon Mobil, and at one point in early 2015 was worth more than $760 billion. Alphabet shares are much more expensive, relatively speaking, than Apple’s, trading around 38 times earnings for the last 12 months, compared to about 11 times for Apple. Alphabet pays no dividend, whereas Apple’s dividend currently yields about 2 percent of the stock’s value annually. Alphabet’s move into the top spot makes it the 12th company to be recognized as the largest publicly traded U.S. name since 1928, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Past No. 1 names include General Electric, General Motors and IBM. Additional reporting by Stephen R.

"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc easily beat Wall Street’s quarterly profit forecasts on Monday, helped by strong mobile advertising sales, sending the shares of Google’s parent higher in after-hours trading to surpass Apple Inc as the most valuable U.S. company. For the first time, the company disclosed the profitability of Google’s search engine and its other online services, and how much it is spending on ambitious technology projects such as self-driving cars. The numbers were lapped up by investors, who saw room for growth in Google’s traditional business, and were relieved to see that spending on new projects it calls ‘Other Bets’ was not as lavish as some had feared. “It’s pretty interesting that 80 percent of YouTube views come from outside of the United States. I didn’t think it would be that high,” said Kevin Kelly, managing partner at Recon Capital. “It demonstrates that the value of YouTube can continue to be extracted,” he said. The operating profit margin for its Google unit was 31.9 percent in the most recent quarter, compared to 25 percent for Alphabet. Alphabet spent $869 million on capital expenditures for the Other Bets in 2015, up from $501 million in 2014. It has not made any projections about if or when those bets cumulatively would become profitable. “As long as the core business continues to operate well with accelerated revenue... investment in those businesses can continue,” said Ronald Josey of JMP Securities. The company said consolidated revenue jumped 17.8 percent to $21.33 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $18.10 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $20.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue for Other Bets was $151 million, up 29.8 percent from $106 million in the same quarter last year, primarily from its smart-home monitoring unit Nest, Google Fiber, which provides high-speed Internet access, and its life sciences business Verily. Adjusted earnings of $8.67 per share handily beat analysts’ average estimate of $8.10 per share. Related CoverageAlphabet passes Apple to become most valuable traded U.S. companyIn a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat attributed the strong earnings to “increased use of mobile search by consumers,” as well as “ongoing momentum” in YouTube and programmatic advertising, referring to the automatic buying of ads. Kelly at Recon Capital said he would not be surprised if YouTube saw a surge in advertising revenues beyond the 17 percent increase it saw during the 2015 fiscal year. Total operating losses on the Other Bets – which include glucose-monitoring contact lenses and Internet balloons - increased to $3.57 billion in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The Google unit houses its Internet and related businesses such as search, ads, maps, YouTube and Android as well as hardware products such as its low-cost Chromebook laptops. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on the call that its Gmail service crossed one billion monthly active users last quarter, joining Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube and Google Play in topping that mark. He also touted the company’s performance during the holiday shopping season, saying that programmatic video impressions doubled this season compared to last, and that 60 percent of them came from mobile devices. But Porat, without providing figures, said the company planned to accelerate capital expenditures in 2016 compared to the previous year. Google’s shares rose almost 5 percent in after-hours trading. Alphabet’s combined share classes were worth $549 billion, compared with Apple, which had a value of about $534 billion. Alphabet will officially overtake Apple in market value if both companies’ shares open around current levels on Tuesday. Google’s advertising revenue increased nearly 17 percent to $19.08 billion, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 31 percent, the company said. Analysts had expected paid clicks to increase 21.8 percent.

"(Reuters) - Technology shares with lofty valuations, including those of midcap data analytics company Tableau Software Inc and Internet giant Facebook Inc, extended their losses on Monday following a gutting selloff in the previous session. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) February 8, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidShares of cloud services companies such as Splunk Inc and Salesforce.com Inc had also declined sharply on Friday. They fell again on Monday, dragging down the Nasdaq Composite index 2.4 percent to its lowest in nearly 1-1/2 years. “I think we’re in an environment right now of shoot first, ask questions later. That’s the mentality of technology investors right now,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. “Any disappointment is being taken out to the woodshed.” These stocks had high valuations before the selloff on Friday, driven by years of hype that spending from enterprise customers was moving to big-data analytics and cloud computing. “I think that what we see is a crisis in valuation for the highest multiple stocks, where valuations ... had been driven too far for thematic reasons, what investors perceived as the hottest growth areas,” Avondale Partners analyst Randle Reece said. The recent declines in the shares have come as some hedge funds have started to sell out of big exposure to the Internet services, software and retail sectors. Long-short hedge funds had taken notably overweight positions in these sectors late in 2015 as other areas of the market faltered while these stocks kept rallying. Those industries dramatically underperformed the broader market last week, with losses of 7 to 12 percent; hedge fund exposures have been reduced, but funds have not yet unwound those positions, according to Credit Suisse prime services. On Monday, Tableau shares fell another 10 percent to $37.28. The stock lost half its market value on Friday after the company cut its 2016 revenue forecast, citing increased competition. “Is Tableau the canary in the coal mine on IT spending or is competition muddying the waters?” RBC Capital Markets analysts asked in a research note. If Tableau, with its lower average selling prices, was finding it difficult to sell its products to enterprise customers, it could mean trouble for companies with more expensive products, RBC said. However, the brokerage noted that companies like Microsoft Corp and SAP SE have reported strong demand. Shares of Workday Inc, Teradata Corp and Hortonworks Inc, which declined on Friday, were down again on Monday, as were shares of Cornerstone OnDemand Inc and Qlik Technologies Inc. Google-owner Alphabet Inc’s shares were also down on Monday. Apple Inc shares were up slightly. Adding to the gloom, IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp forecast its slowest revenue growth in 14 years for the current quarter as clients rein in IT spending. Cognizant’s shares fell 8.5 percent.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), of its decision in a previously unreported Feb. 4 letter to the company posted on the agency’s website this week. Google’s self-driving car unit on Nov. 12 submitted a proposed design for a self-driving car that has “no need for a human driver,” the letter to Google from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Chief Counsel Paul Hemmersbaugh said. “NHTSA will interpret ‘driver’ in the context of Google’s described motor vehicle design as referring to the (self-driving system), and not to any of the vehicle occupants,” NHTSA’s letter said. “We agree with Google its (self-driving car) will not have a ‘driver’ in the traditional sense that vehicles have had drivers during the last more than one hundred years.” Major automakers and technology companies such as Google are racing to develop and sell vehicles that can drive themselves at least part of the time. All participants in the autonomous driving race complain that state and federal safety rules are impeding testing and eventual deployment of such vehicles. California has proposed draft rules requiring steering wheels and a licensed driver in all self-driving cars. Karl Brauer, senior analyst for the Kelley Blue Book automotive research firm, said there were still significant legal questions surrounding autonomous vehicles. But if “NHTSA is prepared to name artificial intelligence as a viable alternative to human-controlled vehicles, it could substantially streamline the process of putting autonomous vehicles on the road,” he said. Related CoverageConcerned by cyber threat, Obama seeks big increase in fundingU.S. lawmakers seek to bar states from mandating encryption weaknessesSee more stories If the car’s computer is the driver for legal purposes, then it clears the way for Google or automakers to design vehicle systems that communicate directly with the vehicle’s artificial pilot. In its response to Google, the federal agency offered its most comprehensive map yet of the legal obstacles to putting fully autonomous vehicles on the road. It noted existing regulations requiring some auto safety equipment can not be waived immediately, including requirements for braking systems activated by foot control. “The next question is whether and how Google could certify that the (self-driving system) meets a standard developed and designed to apply to a vehicle with a human driver,” NHTSA said. Google is “still evaluating” NHTSA’s lengthy response, a company spokesperson said on Tuesday. Google executives have said they would likely partner with established automakers to build self-driving cars. WORRIES ABOUT PEOPLE UNDERMINING SAFETY Google told NHTSA that the real danger is having auto safety features that could tempt humans to try to take control. Google “expresses concern that providing human occupants of the vehicle with mechanisms to control things like steering, acceleration, braking... could be detrimental to safety because the human occupants could attempt to override the (self-driving system’s) decisions,” the NHTSA letter stated. NHTSA’s Hemmersbaugh said federal regulations requiring equipment like steering wheels and brake pedals would have to be formally rewritten before Google could offer cars without those features. For example, current federal rules require alerts on dashboards if tire pressure runs low. NHTSA said a test would need to be created that shows the vehicle computer is informed of the problem. NHTSA raised the question of whether humans in the vehicles should also be made aware. A Google self-driving car is seen inside a lobby at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California November 13, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam In January, NHTSA said it may waive some vehicle safety rules to allow more driverless cars to operate on U.S. roads as part of a broader effort to speed up development of self-driving vehicles. NHTSA said then it would write guidelines for self-driving cars within six months. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the administration may seek new legal authority to allow deployment of autonomous vehicles “in large numbers,” when they are deemed safe, the department said. The process of rewriting federal regulations governing the design, placement and operation of vehicle controls could take months or years. The NHTSA counsel said Google could consider applying for exemptions for certain regulations, providing NHTSA with supporting documents.

The new Google logo is seen at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California November 13, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam The U.S. company has been at loggerheads with several European Union data protection authorities since the European Court of Justice ruled in May 2014 that people could ask search engines such as Google and Microsoft’s Bing (MSFT.O) to remove inadequate or irrelevant information that appears under searches for their name - dubbed the “right to be forgotten”. The French data protection authority in September threatened to fine Google if it did not scrub search results globally across all versions of its website, such as Google.com. But the company has stuck to its position that it should clean up search results only on European domains such as Google.fr or Google.de because to do otherwise would have a chilling effect on the free flow of information. To address the concerns of European authorities, the Internet giant will soon start polishing search results across all its websites when someone conducts a search from the country where the removal request originated, a person close to the company said. That means that if a German resident asks Google to de-list a link popping up under searches for his or her name, the link will not be visible on any version of Google’s website, including Google.com, when the search engine is accessed from Germany. The company will filter search results according to a user’s IP address, meaning people accessing Google from outside Europe will not be affected, the person added. Since the ruling in 2014, Google has received 386,038 requests for removal, according to its transparency website. It has accepted about 42 percent of them. The company has notified all EU data protection authorities of the upcoming changes. A spokeswoman for Britain’s data protection watchdog said the change proposed by Google appeared to address concerns it had previously expressed “on the scope of the requirement to de-list”. A spokeswoman for the French CNIL - which chairs a working group of EU privacy regulators - said authorities had been informed of Google’s plans, which showed that the “issue of territorial scope requires careful thought.” “These elements are currently the object of an inquiry by the services of the CNIL,” she said.

All participants in the autonomous driving race complain that state and federal safety rules are impeding testing and eventual deployment of such vehicles. California has proposed draft rules requiring steering wheels and a licensed driver in all self-driving cars. Karl Brauer, senior analyst for the Kelley Blue Book automotive research firm, said there were still significant legal questions surrounding autonomous vehicles. But if “NHTSA is prepared to name artificial intelligence as a viable alternative to human-controlled vehicles, it could substantially streamline the process of putting autonomous vehicles on the road,” he said. If the car’s computer is the driver for legal purposes, then it clears the way for Google or automakers to design vehicle systems that communicate directly with the vehicle’s artificial pilot. In its response to Google, the federal agency offered its most comprehensive map yet of the legal obstacles to putting fully autonomous vehicles on the road. It noted existing regulations requiring some auto safety equipment can not be waived immediately, including requirements for braking systems activated by foot control. “The next question is whether and how Google could certify that the (self-driving system) meets a standard developed and designed to apply to a vehicle with a human driver,” NHTSA said. Google is “still evaluating” NHTSA’s lengthy response, a company spokesperson said on Tuesday. Google executives have said they would likely partner with established automakers to build self-driving cars. WORRIES ABOUT PEOPLE UNDERMINING SAFETY Google told NHTSA that the real danger is having auto safety features that could tempt humans to try to take control. Google “expresses concern that providing human occupants of the vehicle with mechanisms to control things like steering, acceleration, braking... could be detrimental to safety because the human occupants could attempt to override the (self-driving system’s) decisions,” the NHTSA letter stated. NHTSA’s Hemmersbaugh said federal regulations requiring equipment like steering wheels and brake pedals would have to be formally rewritten before Google could offer cars without those features. For example, current federal rules require alerts on dashboards if tire pressure runs low. NHTSA said a test would need to be created that shows the vehicle computer is informed of the problem. NHTSA raised the question of whether humans in the vehicles should also be made aware. In January, NHTSA said it may waive some vehicle safety rules to allow more driverless cars to operate on U.S. roads as part of a broader effort to speed up development of self-driving vehicles. NHTSA said then it would write guidelines for self-driving cars within six months. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the administration may seek new legal authority to allow deployment of autonomous vehicles “in large numbers,” when they are deemed safe, the department said. The process of rewriting federal regulations governing the design, placement and operation of vehicle controls could take months or years. The NHTSA counsel said Google could consider applying for exemptions for certain regulations, providing NHTSA with supporting documents.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Google’s president for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Matt Brittin, told the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee that the company had paid all the tax that it should but wanted the international tax system reformed. But Stewart Jackson, a Conservative member of the committee, questioned claims that the company was trying to be open about its affairs and supported a rewriting of antiquated tax rules which allow it to shift its profits into Bermuda. “You sort of pose as an enlightened helper to the public debate ... And that the wicked awful tax system across the world somehow just happened to Google, whereas actually you’ve made a choice to avoid tax and set up structures specifically so to do,” he said. Brittin was appearing before the committee for the third time in four years, just weeks after Google had announced a controversial 130 million-pound ($187 million) backtax deal with the UK. News of the deal met with a public outcry, with critics saying the payment of 130 million pounds to cover the last 10 years of earnings was too little, even though finance minister George Osborne initially described the settlement as a major success for the government’s work on tackling tax avoidance. The opposition Labour party and some members of Osborne’s own Conservative party criticized the settlement, which brought Google’s total tax bill for 2005 to 2015 to around 200 million pounds whereas its UK revenues amounted to 24 billion pounds. Tom Hutchinson, Google’s vice president for tax, also told the committee the dispute with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) reflected the complexity of tax law, rather than any attempt not to pay the right amount and that this was echoed in the fact the settlement included no penalty. Google pays an effective tax rate of around 5 percent on non-U.S. profits by channeling earnings from clients in EMEA and Asia into a Bermuda-based, Irish registered company, a Reuters analysis of company filings shows. Meg Hillier, a Labour member of parliament and chair of the committee, said Google should follow the examples of companies like Norway’s Statoil and UK bank Barclays which itemize their earnings and tax payments by country. The Google internet homepage is displayed on a product at a store in London, Britain January 23, 2016. REUTERS/Neil HallThe European Union is debating whether to make such country-by-country reporting mandatory across all industry sectors. In the course of increasingly heated questioning on Thursday, Hillier asked Brittin several times to say how much he was paid. He declined, saying he didn’t know the exact figure but would provide the figure to the committee later, prompting laughter.

" AMSTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) - Google moved 10.7 billion euros ($12 billion) through the Netherlands to Bermuda in 2014, as part of a structure which allows it to earn most of its foreign income tax free. Google's new Canadian engineering headquarters in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario January 14, 2016. REUTERS/Peter Power Accounts for Google Netherlands Holdings BV published on Thursday show the unit transferred almost all its revenue, mainly royalties from an Irish affiliate through which most non-U.S. revenue is channeled, to a Bermuda-based, Irish-registered affiliate called Google Ireland Holdings. The tax strategy is known to accountants as the “double Irish, Dutch Sandwich’. It allows Google, now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes or European withholding taxes on the funds, which represent the bulk of the group’s overseas profits. A Google spokesman said the company follows the tax rules in all the countries where it operates. The decade-old arrangement allowed Alphabet to enjoy an effective tax rate of just 6 percent on its non-U.S. profits last year, around a quarter the average tax rate in its overseas markets. Bermuda charges companies no income tax. Corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the political agenda in European in recent years and Google in particular has been under pressure for the low tax it pays on profits generated from sales in the continent. Last week Google was called to testify to a UK parliamentary committee about a 130 million pounds ($186 million) back tax bill, agreed with the British tax authority in January, that the Opposition Labour party described as “derisory”. The deal brought Google’s total British tax bill for 2005 to 2015 to around 200 million pounds, whereas its UK revenue amounted to 24 billion pounds.

Facebook said on Friday it would stop booking sales to major UK clients via an Irish subsidiary and in future report sales agreed by UK staff in Britain. “In light of changes to tax law in the UK, we felt this change would provide transparency to Facebook’s operations in the UK,” the company said in a statement. The change follows the British government’s introduction last year of a new tax on profits shifted offshore. “From the start of April ... UK sales made directly by our UK team will be booked in the UK, not Ireland,” Facebook added. The California-based company declined to say if it currently booked sales made by UK-based staff, to UK clients, in Dublin. If it did, this would break UK and international tax rules, which require companies to book sales where they are made. Caroline Flint, member of parliament (MP) with the opposition Labour party, said the statement “raises more questions than it answers”. “Facebook are trying to improve their corporate reputation but, in so doing, they appear to have confirmed that UK-based staff were conducting UK sales in the UK, but artificially diverting that income as though it was generated by Facebook Ireland,” she said. Labour MP Nick Smith said the UK tax authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), should have challenged Facebook’s arrangement before now. “Both HMRC and Facebook need to be brought to book over this,” he said. “HMRC should not just give Facebook a wrap over the knuckles over this,” he added. A Facebook spokesman said “we are compliant with UK tax law”. A spokesman for the tax authority said “HMRC ensures that all multinationals pay the tax due under UK law”. ECHO OF GOOGLE In 2013, the parliamentary public accounts committee (PAC) investigated Google over the way it reported revenues from UK clients in Ireland, following a Reuters investigation which showed Google employed dozens of UK salespeople, despite denying staff in Britain made sales to UK clients. Google said then and now that UK customers transacted directly with the company’s Irish staff. A PAC report said in 2013 that Google’s structure was “contrived” and criticized HMRC for being too lenient on big businesses. Google says it complied with all tax rules and HMRC said it treated all taxpayers equally. Google, now part of holding group Alphabet, in January agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($184 million) in UK back taxes and interest and said it would also start to report more revenue in Britain. Crawford Spence, Professor of Accounting at Warwick Business School, said Facebook’s new arrangements lacked sufficient transparency to tell if they would result in the company paying a “fair share” of tax. Prem Sikka, Professor of Accounting at Essex University, said Facebook could easily use alternative arrangements, such as inter-group charges to shift profits out of Britain as effectively under the new arrangement as it does under the current system. HMRC has previously downplayed the potential that increased reporting of revenue in Britain would lead to higher tax bills. The tax authority says it assesses how much value a multinational creates in the UK and assesses its tax bill on that basis, rather than simply following the company’s own accounts of where profits are generated. Facebook’s main UK subsidiary said it had a 28 million pounds loss in 2014, the most recent year for which accounts are available, and a tax charge of just 4,327 pounds. The group does not report UK revenue but analysts said it was likely to run to hundreds of millions of pounds. The company declined to answer questions about its potential future UK tax bills. A spokeswoman for Prime Minister for David Cameron said on Friday the government was “committed to making sure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax”. People walk in front of the Facebook logo at the new Facebook Innovation Hub during a preview media tour in Berlin, Germany, February 24, 2016. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Facebook declined to say whether it planned to change its structure in other European countries. Unlike Google, which shifts non-U.S. profits to Bermuda, a territory with no corporate income tax, Facebook moves profits from overseas back to the United States which has the highest corporate income tax rate in the world. However, this does not lead to big tax payments since it has billion of dollars in tax losses related to investments from earlier years, a Reuters analysis of its filings shows.

REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniQuite a lot, as it turns out, and the Federal Reserve is taking note, especially after a whopping 40,200 food service and drinking establishment jobs were created last month. That represented nearly 17 percent of overall job gains reported by the Labor Department on Friday. Spending at restaurants is also surging and prices are up, reflecting strength in the services sector, which accounts for more than 80 percent of U.S. economic output. If the $16 trillion American economy keeps adding jobs and the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis takes hold more broadly, it will allow the U.S. central bank to make good on its plan to lift interest rates gradually this year. Although waitstaff and line cooks do not generally make big salaries, they are part of a broader story: dollars spent in restaurants are going directly into the pockets of other Americans, and for the Fed, that may point to sustainable economic growth and the beginning of a long-awaited rise in inflation. With a slowing global economy and a strong dollar weighing on U.S. exports and manufacturing, the services sector “is going to be the driver, not only of jobs and growth for the next year or so, but also for inflation,” San Francisco Fed President John Williams said after a speech earlier this week in San Ramon, an affluent city in northern California. Williams knows a thing or two about restaurants: he once managed a well-known San Francisco pizza joint called Blondies. Chef and restaurant owner Rodney Worth sees the driving force of dining out first-hand. “We’re killing it,” he says, of sales at his seven restaurants in the San Francisco area, where he is seeing more guests ordering $11 sloppy joes and $18 brisket as well as desserts, good wines and specialty cocktails. That jump in business has a downside that reflects a tighter job market and lends support to Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s argument that falling unemployment - now at 4.9 percent nationally - and rising wages will push inflation higher. “It’s very hard to find catering managers, servers, cooks, and it’s almost impossible to hire chefs right now,” Worth says, adding that he has had to offer bonuses and higher pay to compete for staff against technology giants like Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, which have their own on-campus kitchens. He’s had to increase prices, in part because of higher minimum wages, but he also felt comfortable enough to recently open a new restaurant, Worth Ranch, in San Ramon, some 35 miles (56 km) east of San Francisco. ‘DO IT BIG’ The growth is not confined to California’s booming, tech-driven corner of the U.S. economy. What one Dallas Fed economist refers to as the “dining out” price index gained an annualized 4.4 percent nationally in January, according to government data released last week. Weekly earnings in the leisure and hospitality sector, which includes restaurants, dropped about $2 to $380.80 in February, a smaller dip than for overall wages, according to Friday’s jobs report. The decline was largely driven by a statistical quirk. Cheaper gas, which is putting extra cash in American wallets, is one of the tailwinds driving growth at restaurants and other eateries, says Hudson Riehle, head of research at the National Restaurant Association. Sales within the industry are expected to rise 5 percent to $783 billion this year, with growth in quick-service outlets outpacing fine dining, Riehle says. That would represent a roughly 20 percent jump from 2012. Shares of restaurant companies such as El Pollo Loco (LOCO.O) and Cosi COSI.O are slowly rebounding after sharp sell-offs last year. Bakery-cafe chain Panera Bread PNRA.O, which forecasts as much as 4.5 percent sales growth in 2016 for its company-owned outlets in North America, has seen its shares rise about 13 percent since the start of the year. Slideshow (5 Images)Restaurant sales reflect stronger job growth in the overall economy and as workers on low incomes tend to spend, “the economic multiplier effect of that on both employment and economic growth overall is substantial,” Riehle said. For Worth, it’s all connected. His catering business all but dried up after the Great Recession, but in the past year he has had to buy an extra van to handle the surge in business from both local firms and households. “They used to ask for pricing on sandwich platters,” Worth said. “Now they are saying ‘show up and do it big - we are not really looking at pricing.’” Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Paul SimaoOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Prem Sikka, Professor of Accounting at Essex University, said Facebook could easily use alternative arrangements, such as inter-group charges to shift profits out of Britain as effectively under the new arrangement as it does under the current system. HMRC has previously downplayed the potential that increased reporting of revenue in Britain would lead to higher tax bills. The tax authority says it assesses how much value a multinational creates in the UK and assesses its tax bill on that basis, rather than simply following the company’s own accounts of where profits are generated. Facebook’s main UK subsidiary said it had a 28 million pounds loss in 2014, the most recent year for which accounts are available, and a tax charge of just 4,327 pounds. The group does not report UK revenue but analysts said it was likely to run to hundreds of millions of pounds. The company declined to answer questions about its potential future UK tax bills. A spokeswoman for Prime Minister for David Cameron said on Friday the government was “committed to making sure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax”.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Facebook declined to say whether it planned to change its structure in other European countries. Unlike Google, which shifts non-U.S. profits to Bermuda, a territory with no corporate income tax, Facebook moves profits from overseas back to the United States which has the highest corporate income tax rate in the world. However, this does not lead to big tax payments since it has billion of dollars in tax losses related to investments from earlier years, a Reuters analysis of its filings shows.

"(Adds details on T-Mobile, Puerto Rico Telephone company; Liberty and Comcast could not be reached for comment) By David Shepardson and Malathi Nayak WASHINGTON/NEW YORK March 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Friday that it had received 104 applications to take part in an auction of valuable low-frequency airwaves relinquished by TV broadcasters, including many wireless companies who want to use the airwaves to build new networks or improve existing coverage. The government plays the middleman in the auction designed so broadcasters are incentivized to sell at the lowest rates and telecom companies are encouraged to buy at the highest rates. The government keeps a large part of the difference. The FCC said 69 applications are complete and 35 are incomplete. The incomplete applicants have until April 6 to finish their application. The applicants include subsidiaries of Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc and Liberty Global Plc and many U.S. rural carriers. Some applications were filed by individuals, partnerships, consortiums or other corporate entities and ownership of the entities will not be publicly known until Monday. Also applying to bid is Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc, a firm owned by Mexican telecom giant America Movil SAB, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim. In an FCC filing from February seen by Reuters, Liberty’s subsidiary “Liberty Spectrum Inc” told the agency that it may bid on one or more blocks of low-frequency spectrum in the auction to potentially provide mobile wireless services in Puerto Rico. Liberty Global, headquartered in London and backed by cable pioneer John Malone, could not be immediately reached for comment. Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp. backs U.S.-based pay-TV provider Charter Communications Inc, which appeared on Friday to be absent from the FCC’s list although more details could emerge on Monday once the agency releases the auction applications. Charter’s chief executive has said in recent weeks participation in the auction was unlikely. Comcast Corp and Dish Network Corp both said previously they planned to bid. A person familiar with the bids said that cable company Comcast had bid through a company with a different name. Comcast did not respond to a request for comment. Silicon Valley investment firm Social Capital has said it will take part and filed an application, while the No.4 U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp and Alphabet Inc, which participated but did not buy in a 2008 auction, have said they are sitting out. Analysts forecast that the upcoming auction could fetch proceeds in the $15 billion to $45 billion range, but they expect bidders to be less aggressive than in the FCC’s last auction, the “AWS-3 auction,” which ended last year and set a record of $44.9 billion in bids. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said earlier this month that he was “encouraged by the strong interest that we have seen both from broadcasters interested in selling their spectrum and the broad assortment of parties interested in buying it.” Separately, the FCC said Friday that a decision by a federal appeals court late Thursday to allow Latina Broadcasters to provisionally participate in the auction that begins March 29 will not delay the auction. The FCC in February denied Latina Broadcasters application to participate.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is ready to make a bid for Yahoo’s web business, and hopes to make a merger more successful by also making an offer for a stake in Yahoo’s Japan subsidiary, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter. A website of Yahoo Japan Corp is seen on a computer screen in Tokyo August 19, 2009. REUTERS/Stringer The telecom giant is planning to make a first-round bid for Yahoo’s web business next week, the news organization said. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google unit is also mulling a bid for Yahoo’s core business, Bloomberg reported, citing a source. However, Bloomberg said many companies that had been seen as likely investors in Yahoo were not planning a bid, including AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Shares of Yahoo fell just over 1 percent to $36.17. Verizon, Yahoo and Google declined to comment for this story. AT&T, Comcast and Microsoft could not be reached immediately for comments. Verizon showed interest in Yahoo’s core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would “see if there is a strategic fit” for its holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology. Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). The offer to purchase Yahoo’s 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan could put Verizon one step ahead of any rival bidders. The offer will also likely leave Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer out of the mix, since Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said in a recent television appearance that merging Yahoo’s assets with AOL assets under the leadership of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong “would be a good thing for investors.” The New York Post reported last month that Mayer has been working to team up with private equity firms to create a “package deal” that sells the company and keeps her at the helm. Verizon shares were down 2.84 percent. Additional reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by David GregorioOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"BOSTON, April 7 (Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc issued an emergency update on Thursday to its widely used Flash software for Internet browsers after researchers discovered a security flaw that was being exploited to deliver ransomware to Windows PCs. The software maker urged the more than 1 billion users of Flash on Windows, Mac, Chrome and Linux computers to update the product as quickly as possible after security researchers said the bug was being exploited in “drive-by” attacks that infect computers with ransomware when tainted websites are visited. Ransomware encrypts data, locking up computers, then demands payments that often range from $200 to $600 to unlock each infected PC. Adobe’s new patch fixes a previously unknown security flaw. Such bugs, known as “zero days,” are highly prized because they are harder to defend against since software makers and security firms have not had time to figure out ways to block them. They are typically used by nation states for espionage and sabotage, not by cyber criminals who tend to use widely known bugs for their attacks. Use of a “zero day” to distribute ransomware highlights the severity of a growing ransomware epidemic, which has disrupted operations at a wide range of organizations across the United States and Europe, including hospitals, police stations and school districts. Last week, the U.S. and Canadian governments issued a warning about the growing threat as a ransomware attack shut down computer systems at MedStar Health, the largest hospital chain in the Washington, DC, area. Ransomware schemes have boomed in recent months, with increasingly sophisticated techniques and tools used in such operations. “The deployment of a zero day highlights potential advancement by cyber criminals,” said Kyrk Storer, a spokesman for FireEye Inc, which helped analyze the vulnerability and attacks. “We have observed ransomware and crimeware deployed via ‘zero-day’ before; however, it is rare.” FireEye said that the bug was being leveraged to deliver ransomware in what is known as the Magnitude Exploit Kit. This is an automated tool sold on underground forums that hackers use to infect PCs with viruses through tainted websites. Exploit kits are used for “drive-by” attacks that automatically seek to attack the computers of people who view an infected website. Adobe said the issue was brought to its attention by researchers with FireEye, Alphabet Inc’s Google and email security provider ProofPoint Inc.

"WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday weighed into the debate over allowing consumers to switch pricey cable television boxes for less expensive devices, urging an agency to set an example for other parts of government to boost competition. Consumers can spend nearly $1,000 over four years for renting cable set top boxes. Opening the business to competition and allowing consumers to chose devices or apps they can own could mean quick savings, an official said. “You could have a set a standards such that anyone could connect any box to their cable and those boxes could compete for lower prices and greater innovation,” Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers told reporters in a teleconference. The Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, in February proposed a rule opening competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. It set a 60 day comment period on the rule that could cost major cable companies. The rule would allow consumers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers such Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications . It is unclear if the rule will be implemented before Obama leaves office next January. Cable and television companies have lashed out against the proposal saying it could stifle innovation. The administration entered the debate through a rare filing into the FCC’s comment period. “When the President personally gets involved is when it’s of real great importance, in his mind, to consumers, to competition, and to the economy more broadly,” Furman said. Obama will also sign an executive order on Friday calling on federal agencies and departments to report in 60 days on specific areas where additional measures can be taken to open competition. Furman would not venture a guess on what kind of pro competition measures that order could spur. The administration is looking to add to actions it has already taken for consumers on cell phones, net neutrality and retirement advice. “This is going to be a whole of government effort to empower consumers, workers and small businesses,” Furman said.

"(Corrects for dropped word ‘billion’ in second paragraph) By Deborah M. Todd and Narottam Medhora April 21 (Reuters) - Google’s parent Alphabet Inc missed Wall Street targets for first-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday, driving shares of the Web search company down more than 4 percent in late trading on Thursday. Alphabet, the world’s No.2 publicly traded company by market capitalization, said consolidated revenue rose to $20.26 billion from $17.26 billion. That was slightly below the $20.37 billion analyst consensus, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings per share of $7.50, excluding one-time items, missed the analyst target of $7.97. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen said the effect of foreign currency was worse for Alphabet than expected. “If there had been a little better foreign currency translation, it would have been better than the Street consensus,” he said. On a conference call after the earnings announcement, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said, “As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $762 million, or $593 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23%” year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially reflecting holiday seasonality.” Cost-per-click, or the average price of online ads, fell 9 percent in the quarter ended March 31, although Pyykkonen said some analysts had been expecting a decline of 10 percent. Google’s advertising revenue increased 16.2 percent to $18.02 billion, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 29 percent, the company said. Losses increased at the company’s Other Bets business, which includes its broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving cars and X - the company’s research facility that works on “moon shot” ventures. The loss widened to $802 million, up from $633 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to $166 million from $80 million. Alphabet’s net income rose to $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, from $3.52 billion, or $5.10 per share. The company’s shares fell to $744.21 in after hours trade from a close of $780.

The S&P technology sector dropped 1.9 percent, its worst decline since early February, with Facebook down 2.5 percent and Intel falling 1.03 percent. Microsoft dropped 7.17 percent, contributing the biggest drag to the S&P 500, and Google-parent Alphabet lost 5.41 percent as investors punished both companies for missing profit and revenue estimates. It was Alphabet’s worst day since 2012. Helped by a softer dollar and a recovery in oil prices, the S&P 500 has rebounded from a steep selloff earlier this year and is only about 2 percent short of last May’s record high. Wall Street has rock-bottom expectations as companies post their first-quarter results over the next few weeks, with S&P 500 companies on average seen reporting a 7.1-percent fall in profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Crude rose over 1 percent on signs of strong U.S. gasoline consumption, declining production around the world and oilfield outages. Oil prices have moved in lockstep with U.S. stocks for several months and some investors expected more gains next week.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google unit (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N), the ride-sharing service Uber [UBER.UL] and two other companies said on Tuesday they are forming a coalition to push for federal action to help speed self-driving cars to market. A security guard keeps watch as he walks past a logo of Google at an exhibition stage during the 4th China (Shanghai) International Technology Fair 2016 in Shanghai, China, April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Aly SongSweden-based Volvo Cars, which is owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co GEELY.UL, and Uber rival Lyft also are part of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The group said in a statement it will “work with lawmakers, regulators and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles.” The coalition said David Strickland, the former top official of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the top U.S. auto safety agency that is writing new guidance on self-driving cars, will be the coalition’s counsel and spokesman. “What people are looking for is clear rules of the road of what needs to be done for (fully autonomous) vehicles to be on the road,” Strickland said in an interview Tuesday, emphasizing the companies want to deploy them safely. “Nobody wants to take a shortcut on this.” Strickland, who has advised Google on self-driving car issues, said the group is “a full policy and messaging campaign and movement” and not just about lobbying lawmakers or regulators. In 2014 there were 32,675 fatalities and 2.3 million injured in 6.1 million crashes on U.S. roads. NHTSA says about 94 percent of all traffic crashes are caused by human error. On Wednesday, NHTSA is holding the second of two public forums on its self-driving car guidelines that will feature comments from tech companies and automakers at Stanford University. NHTSA did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the coalition. Ford said in a statement the group will “work together to advocate for policy solutions that will support the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles.” NHTSA hopes to release its guidance to states, policymakers and companies on self-driving vehicles in July. California has proposed barring self-driving cars that do not have steering wheels, pedals and a licensed driver ready to take over in an emergency, which Google has opposed. Under current regulations, fully autonomous vehicles without human controls are not legal. NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind has said policymakers should avoid a “patchwork” of state regulations on self-driving cars but has not taken a position on California’s proposal. In February, NHTSA said the artificial intelligence system piloting a self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal law, a major step toward winning approval for autonomous vehicles. The five companies, which all are working on self-driving cars, say one of the group’s first tasks is to “work with civic organizations, municipalities and businesses to bring the vision of self-driving vehicles to America’s roads and highways.” Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Bill Trott and Alan CrosbyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Apple’s results followed disappointing quarterly reports from Microsoft Corp(MSFT.O) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and microblog Twitter (TWTR.N) also on Tuesday reported results that missed expectations. Apple said it sold 51.2 million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter, down from 61.2 million in the same quarter a year ago but above analysts’ estimates of about 50 million devices. While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise. After years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple’s exponential growth. “Apple needs to come up with a radical new innovation or product rather than just the current incremental improvements to existing products. This is the only way in which it will reinvigorate sales growth,” said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. “The iPhone 6 is an anomaly,” he said. But Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts that the smartphone market was not growing, reinforcing wider concerns of saturation. Cook also conceded that the iPhone 6S was driving customers to replace phones at a much lower rate than the 6. “I don’t mean just a hair lower; it’s a lot lower,” he said. “If we’d had the same rate on 6S as 6, it would be time for a huge party.” He pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales. Cook also hinted that Apple had more gadgets to come. “The future of Apple is very bright,” he said. “Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store.” Earnings of $1.90 per share fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $50.56 billion missed expectations of $51.97 billion. Apple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion. Apple also said it was raising its capital return program by $50 billion through a $35 billion increase in its share buyback authorization and a 10 percent rise in the quarterly dividend. iPHONE SE DEMAND STRONG In March, Apple released the iPhone SE, a smaller, 4-inch-screen phone featuring much of the company’s latest technology. Although sales of the phone were not captured in the second quarter, the device is off to a strong start, particularly in emerging markets, Maestri said. “The situation right now around the world is that we are supply-constrained,” he said. “The demand has been very, very strong.” Although Apple’s revenue in Greater China fell 26 percent from the year-ago quarter, Maestri stressed that the company was “extremely optimistic” about China. “We continue to make a lot of investment there,” he said. Cook said that mainland China sales were down only 7 percent in constant currency, attributing much of the Greater China drop to Hong Kong, where strength in the local dollar, which is pegged to U.S. currency, deterred tourist shopping.

In reaction to Apple’s results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), Qorvo (QRVO.O), Broadcom (AVGO.O) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday.

"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) quarterly revenue rose more than 50 percent, handily beating Wall Street expectations as its wildly popular mobile app and a push into live video lured new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to boost spending. The company’s shares rose 9.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $118.39, setting it on track to open at a new high on Thursday, at nearly triple its initial public offering four years ago. Facebook also announced it will create a new class of non-voting shares in a move aimed at letting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg give away his wealth without relinquishing control of the social media juggernaut he founded. The company plans to create a new class of non-voting shares, which would be given as a dividend to existing shareholders. That would allow Zuckerberg, who wants to give away 99 percent of his wealth, to sell non-voting stock to fund philanthropy and keep the voting stock that assures his control. Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) passed a similar proposal in 2014 that ensured its founders’ control by creating new non-voting shares. Some 1.65 billion people used Facebook monthly as of March 31, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. Zuckerberg said users were spending more than 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, a huge amount of time given the millions of apps available to users. Advertisers are shifting money from television to web and mobile platforms, and Facebook is one of the biggest beneficiaries. It faces fierce competition in the mobile video market, where rivals Snapchat and YouTube also garner billions of video views every day. Facebook recently expanded its live video product, rolling out several new features and making it more prominent on the app to encourage users to create videos and share them. The quarterly results showed success attracting advertisers with the move, and the company was able to expand its operating profit margin to 55 percent from 52 percent a year earlier. “The company consistently ‘warns’ about higher spending, but they consistently manage their spending to deliver earnings upside. They’re an impressive company, and they leave very little room for criticism,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who called the operating margin a good surprise. Facebook did not offer details on sales of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, but emphasized that it was early days and said that sales would not significantly impact 2016 revenue. The results come after disappointments for investors from several major Silicon Valley firms. “After Intel and IBM last week, and then Twitter and Apple yesterday, this is by far the best number I’ve seen in technology,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company which owns about $40 million worth of Facebook shares, commenting specifically about Facebook ad revenue. Facebook has not begun advertising on some of its most popular apps. “They haven’t yet turned on the monetization spigot for Messenger or WhatsApp, so there should be significant headroom still,” said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. The company’s net income attributable to common shareholders nearly tripled to $1.51 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the first quarter from $509 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, beating Wall Street’s 62-cent consensus. Total revenue rose to $5.38 billion from $3.54 billion, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.20 billion. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 percent of total ad revenue, compared with about 73 percent a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $5.26 billion. If the stock proposal is approved - and Zuckerberg has a majority of voting stock - the company will effectively carry out a 3-for-1 stock split, issuing two shares of non-voting Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend for each share of Class A and Class B common stock. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced last year that they would give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares to fund charitable endeavors. People are silhouetted as they pose with mobile devices in front of a screen projected with a Facebook logo, in this picture illustration taken in Zenica October 29, 2014. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Investors said they were not concerned that Zuckerberg would have increasing control, pointing to the company’s consistent ability to grow and exceed expectations. “I honestly don’t think anyone cares if he has more power, since he’s done everything right since they went public,” said Pachter.

" (Corrects May 4 story to show AgFunder is an online investment platform, not a market research firm, paragraph 19.) An employee navigates a tractor which is equipped with a screen showing the output of liquid applied on a field in Irlbach near Deggendorf, Germany, April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Michaela RehleBy Ludwig Burger IRLBACH, Germany (Reuters) - Global pesticides, seeds and fertilizer companies may be forced to re-engineer their business models as farmers adopt specialist technology that helps maximize harvests while reducing the use of crop chemicals. New businesses are springing up that promise to tell farmers how and when to till, sow, spray, fertilize or pick crops based on algorithms using data from their own fields. Their emphasis on reducing the use of chemicals and minerals known as farming inputs is a further challenge for an industry already struggling with weak agricultural markets worldwide. “If our only goal is to sell as much inputs as possible by the liters of chemicals, I think we would have a real problem going forward,” said Liam Condon, head of Crop Science at Bayer, the world’s second-largest pesticides supplier. Bayer bought proPlant, a developer of software for plant health diagnostics, earlier this year. Rivals are also investing in digital farming with the aim of generating service revenues that could offset any future drop in chemicals volumes. “If you only spray half of the field that’s much less inputs,” Condon added. “The knowledge to get to the fact that you only spray that part of the field — that, you can sell.” After an aborted takeover move for Syngenta, U.S. seeds giant Monsanto says data science and services are the “glue that holds the pieces together” of its strategy for future growth. Monsanto’s $1 billion purchase in 2013 of the Climate Corporation, which analyses weather conditions, was the digital farming sector’s biggest deal to date. DuPont is investing in digital farm management services under its Encirca brand, which it said in March had customers representing more than 1 million acres of farmland. Monsanto’s failed swoop on Syngenta triggered a bout of M&A activity that has left the global seeds and pesticides industry in turmoil. The sector has annual sales of more than $100 billion, while fertilisers are worth around $175 billion. Dow Chemical and DuPont are set to merge in the second half of this year while state-owned ChemChina agreed a takeover of Syngenta in February. ON THE GROUND At the 970-hectare farm in Bavaria where Juergen Schwarzensteiner rotates corn, potatoes and grains, satellite maps and software supplied three years ago by a unit of farming goods distributor BayWa have prompted many changes. Related CoverageFactbox: How digital farming tools boost efficiency and yieldsThese include reducing the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer — a risk to drinking water quality and the environment — and cutting down on other fertilisers. “This plot has had top yields consistently over the years, where I used to just say, that’s great,” says the farmer, eyeing a red and green patterned computer map showing big discrepancies in how well plants are growing just half a mile apart. “Then we got the digital maps and differences became apparent that were not clear to the eye before.” Schwarzensteiner’s experiences using the technology have secured him a side job advising a farm in Siberia that is about 100 times the size of the one he manages at Irlbach, near the river Danube in Germany. As well as BayWa’s FarmFacts, farm management software startups include Iowa-based Farmers Business Network Inc, backed by Alphabet Inc and investor Kleiner Perkins, and Missouri-based FarmLink LLC. All aim to provide farmers with individualized prescriptions on how to work each field down to a fraction of an acre, using data they have collected on soil and weather conditions, the use of crop chemicals and crop yields. Feedback from the farmers they have advised in turn allows the companies to fine-tune their computer models of plant growth. RISKS AND CHALLENGES According to online agriculture investment platform AgFunder, venture capital investments in food and agriculture technology nearly doubled to $4.6 billion last year, with “precision agriculture” startups raising $661 million in 2015, up 140 percent from 2014. Syngenta bought seven agricultural technology firms last year alone, AgFunder said. For now, the main aim of these companies is to help farmers using their drones, field robots, decision support software and smart irrigation systems to boost yields, said Carsten Gerhardt, a chemicals industry specialist at advisors A.T. Kearney. “But in the mid- to longer-term, I also expect there to be a reduction in the use of input factors by about 30 to 40 percent,” he added. “There’s a risk for established players if digital services providers can convince farmers that they can settle for the second-best herbicide and show what really counts is a more precise way of using it.” Eric Bartels, a partner at McKinsey who focuses on the agricultural industry, said developing new pesticides would help companies hedge against any drop in sales, however, because farmers will pay a premium to keep their fields pest-free. Another question is whether today’s chemicals and farm nutrients giants can capture the farm management software market for themselves. Gerhardt said digital startups would struggle to catch up with established players’ knowledge of plant biology and the farm business, and to build a global sales network. But Rabobank’s farm sector analyst Harry Smit says crop chemicals and seed players diversifying into such services will struggle to be seen as providers of impartial advice. Slideshow (14 Images)That was one of the reasons why German grain and sugar beet seed maker KWS Saat, among the world’s top five seed makers, decided not to invest in digital farming platforms. “Farmers want independence,” KWS finance chief Eva Kienle said. “They don’t want to get the impression they are being recommended a product just because the supplier is earning a profit on it.” Editing by Catherine EvansOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"PARIS (Reuters) - Dozens of French police raided Google’s (GOOGL.O) Paris headquarters on Tuesday, escalating an investigation into the digital giant on suspicion of tax evasion. A Google carpet is seen at the entrance of the new headquarters of Google France before its official inauguration in Paris, France December 6, 2011. REUTERS/Jacques Brinon/Pool/File PhotoGoogle, which said it was fully complying with French law, is under pressure across Europe from public opinion and governments angry at the way multinationals exploit their presence around the world to minimize the tax they pay. Investigators from the financial prosecutors office and France’s central office against corruption and tax fraud, accompanied by 25 IT specialists, took part in the raid. “The investigation aims to verify whether Google Ireland Ltd has a permanent base in France and if, by not declaring parts of its activities carried out in France, it failed its fiscal obligations, including on corporate tax and value added tax,” the prosecutor’s office said in statement. Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, pays little tax in most European countries because it reports almost all sales in Ireland. This is possible thanks to a loophole in international tax law but it hinges on staff in Dublin concluding all sales contracts. If staff in countries like France finalize contracts with local clients, then the company would be obliged to report the revenues nationally and pay taxes in each country. Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Europe, said in an email: “We are cooperating with the authorities to answer their questions. We comply fully with French law.” Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, approached for a reaction at a conference in Amsterdam, declined to comment. Related CoverageGoogle says complies with French law, cooperating with authorities“HEAVY OPERATION” Tuesday’s raid was carried out as part of an investigation into aggravated tax fraud and the organized laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud. The probe, triggered by a complaint by the French tax authorities, started in June last year but was only made public on Tuesday. “This is a heavy operation,” the judicial source said, referring to how many people took part in the raid. “It’s quite an unusual one.” Should it be found guilty, Google faces either up to 10 million euros ($11.14 million) in fines or a fine of half of the value of the laundered amount involved. Budget Minister Christian Eckert, who declined to confirm or deny the sums involved in the Google case on Public Senat television, said France had raked in 3.3 billion euros in back taxes and penalties from just five multinationals in 2015. Separately, French tax authorities are seeking some 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in back taxes from Google, a finance ministry source said in February. It wasn’t clear to what extent the judicial investigation made public on Tuesday was related to the tax authorities’ case or was part of a larger probe into Google’s tax practices. A Reuters investigation in 2013 found that while Google said it didn’t sell in countries like Britain and France, it advertised "sales" jobs in London and Paris which it said would involve "negotiating deals" and meeting "sales quotas". (reut.rs/1RnJZe2) Slideshow (2 Images)The group agreed in January to pay 130 million pounds in back taxes to Britain, prompting criticism from opposition lawmakers and campaigners that the sum was too low.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A small but growing number of companies are starting to target Generation Z - the 69 million high school-age kids and younger who will soon outnumber the millennials before them - and they are not just pitching typical teen products such as acne creams and video games. Cans of Campbell's soup line the shelves at a local grocery store in Golden, Colorado September 11, 2009. REUTERS/Rick Wilking Companies ranging from Macy’s Inc to Campbell Soup Co to Charles Schwab Corp are talking to investors about their long-term plans to appeal to the post-millennial generation, a group that Pew Research expects to make up 40 percent of the U.S. workforce by 2020 and ultimately surpass the 75.4 million millennials and 74.9 million baby boomers. “It’s a matter of survival to get new customers. Today’s 18 year old is only 10 years away from being someone with a job and savings and trying to figure out a 401(k) for the first time,” said Peter Tuz, portfolio manager of the $84 million Chase Growth Fund. He is shying away from mall-based retailers as teens increasingly shop online. Gregg Fisher, portfolio manager of the Gerstein Fisher Multi-Factor Growth Equity fund, said that he is buying shares of Google-parent Alphabet and Apple IncO> in part because he expects that they will be able to adapt and continue to appeal to Generation Z, a group that he is familiar with by watching the habits of his 13 year old son. “It’s like someone in the U.S. who was investing in China in the early 90s. There’s a huge opportunity here for companies that are willing to take some risk and bet on the future,” he said. Generation Z differs from previous generations in that its members have grown up with smartphones and the internet, making them more focused on speed of service. Many also saw their parents struggle during the Great Recession, making them more risk-averse, said Sean Mahoney, editorial director at advertising agency Sparks and Honey. Ten major companies have specifically addressed Generation Z in earnings calls and investor presentations since the start of the year, according to a Reuters analysis of transcripts, more than the previous number of mentions by all companies over the last six years combined. Campbell cited Generation Z’s focus on transparency as part of its decision to stop opposing labeling for foods containing genetically modified ingredients. Charles Schwab said that its financial advisers would transition more to becoming “life coaches” rather than making specific investment decisions as technology-trusting Generation Z comes of age and places more faith in computer models than humans when investing. All of the companies mentioning Generation Z are consumer-focused, suggesting that they are the most pressed to demonstrate to investors that they have a pipeline of future customers, investors say. SIGNS OF A NEW GENERATION Companies have targeted teens for generations, but what makes this effort different is that the majority of the 10 companies talking about Generation Z now are not traditional teen marketers. They are instead focused on making their products appealing to customers years away from their typical customers. Food is increasingly viewed as an entertainment choice, with teens spending 20 percent more of their dollars at restaurants than millennials were in 2003, according to a report from Piper Jaffray. Restaurant-equipment maker Middleby Corp, for instance, told investors that with smartphones and apps such as that of food-delivery service Seamless, Generation Z now expects all restaurants to offer delivery. That should lead to increased demand for its high-speed ovens to handle greater volumes, the company said. “When I look at the next five to 10 years, Middleby is so well-positioned with this generation,” the company’s chief executive, Selim Bassoul, told analysts.

"A Microsoft logo is seen on an office building in New York City in this July 28, 2015 file photo. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files - RTSFWF8(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc have agreed to jointly build a subsea cable across the Atlantic Ocean to meet growing demand for high-speed cloud and online services. The construction of the new “MAREA” cable will begin in August and it is expected to be completed in October 2017, the companies said in a statement on Thursday. The 6,600 kilometer cable, the first to connect the United States with southern Europe, will be operated and managed by Telefonica SA’s telecoms infrastructure unit Telxius. The cable is initially designed to carry 160 terabits of data per second, the companies said. The move comes nearly two years after Google Inc, now Alphabet Inc, agreed with five Asian companies to invest about $300 million to develop and operate a trans-Pacific cable network connecting the United States to Japan. (reut.rs/1P0LEvN) Microsoft has also been experimenting with underwater datacenters under its Project Natick, and last year tested a prototype on the seafloor for four months. Underwater datacenters, envisioned to be powered by renewable marine energy sources, is expected to reduce the huge cost associated with cooling datacenters that generate a lot of heat, and also to reduce the distance to connected populations. Microsoft on Thursday declined to disclose the financial details about MAREA. Facebook did not immediately respond for comment.

"(Reuters) - Tony Fadell, a well-known Silicon Valley executive who was once expected to play a central role in Alphabet Inc’s hardware efforts, has stepped down as chief executive of the search giant’s Nest unit, the company said. Honoree and founder of Nest, Tony Fadell, arrives at the Time 100 gala celebrating the magazine's naming of the 100 most influential people in the world for the past year in New York April 29, 2014. REUTERS/Lucas JacksonFadell will remain an adviser to Alphabet and Google co-founder Larry Page. He will be replaced at Nest, which makes smart thermostats and smoke detectors, by Marwan Fawaz, who had prior stints at Motorola Mobility and Charter Communications Inc. Google bought Nest in 2014 for $3.2 billion, one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever. In a blog post announcing his departure, Fadell said Nest’s revenue is growing 50 percent a year and boasted that “the connected home went mainstream because of Nest.” “We’ve created a hardware + software + services ecosystem, which is still in the early growth stage and will continue to evolve to move further into the mainstream over the coming years,” Fadell wrote. Fadell started Nest in 2011 after a high-profile run at Apple Inc, where he was an important player in the development of the iPod and the iPhone. Top-tier venture capital investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers and Google Ventures backed Nest, which set out to build a smart thermostat and related products. But Fadell and Nest have had a bumpy ride under Alphabet. Nest had to recall a smoke detector in 2014 for a software defect that caused a safety risk, and critics said it was slow to roll out new products. The $555 million acquisition of webcam startup Dropcam did not go well, with Fadell openly criticizing the quality of the team in a news report earlier this year in the trade publication The Information. The story aired numerous complaints about Fadell’s allegedly abrasive leadership. Dropcam co-founder Greg Duffy responded with a blistering blog post in which he accused Fadell of “blatant scapegoating” and said he regretted selling the company. Duffy also said there had been a huge exodus of employees from Nest. Fadell said in his blog that he had been planning to leave since late last year. He did not say what he intended to do next, though he recently unveiled a new company, Actev Motors, that makes a smart go-cart for kids. In a statement Friday, Page called Fadell a “true visionary” and praised his accomplishments at Nest.

"BOSTON (Reuters) - Investment firm Tiger Global, known for making big bets on technology companies, told clients on Thursday that its hedge fund climbed 2.3 percent last month, helping shrink its year-to-date losses, a source familiar with the numbers said. May’s gain, fueled by stronger returns at some of its biggest holdings including Netflix, Amazon.com and Apple Inc, helped shrink the fund’s year-to-date loss to 18.1 percent, the source said. A number of hedge funds posted stronger returns in May as some battered stocks recovered, helping them either shrink their year-to-date losses or erase them completely. Despite May’s gains, Tiger Global, which manages roughly $20 billion and has some $6 billion in its hedge fund, still ranks among the year’s worst-performing funds, according to industry analysts, after its top tech holdings suffered heavy losses in early 2016. The decline marks a rare misstep for the firm, which earned a 6.8 percent return in 2015, according to investors, when the average hedge fund lost money. A regulatory filing showed that at the end of the first quarter, Tiger Global owned a small investment of 275,000 shares in LendingClub, the online platform that forced out its chief executive officer in early May after its board found evidence of falsified data on some loans. The stock price tumbled last month, and it was not clear whether Tiger Global still held the position in May. 2016 has shaped up as the worst year since the financial crisis for hedge funds, with poor returns prompting investors to pull out roughly $17 billion in assets during the first quarter, eVestment data show. Viking Global Investors, run by Andreas Halvorsen, had a strong May as its fund climbed 5.7 percent, shrinking its year-to-date loss to 2.8 percent, a person familiar with the number said. Some of its biggest holdings, including Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com rebounded in May. Fund manager Mark Kingdon also shrunk his year-to-date loss with a strong gain in May. The Kingdon Global Long/Short Equity fund climbed 5.24 percent last month, leaving it off 3.16 percent for the year, a person familiar with the numbers said. Clint Carlson’s Carlson Capital’s flagship multi-strategy Double Black Diamond fund moved into the black in May. The fund climbed 2.3 percent in the month and is up 1.24 percent for the year, a person familiar with the numbers said. The firm’s $1.1 billion equity long-short Black Diamond Thematic fund rose 3.64 percent in May, extending its year-to-date gains to 13.25 percent. Carlson Capital oversees $9 billion in assets. Reade Griffith’s Polygon European Equity Opportunity Fund, which manages $650 million, gained 2.3 percent in May, extending its year-to-date gain to 8.9 percent, a person who has seen the numbers said. Renaissance Technologies, one of the world’s most prominent hedge funds with roughly $27 billion in assets, posted small gains in its Renaissance Institutional Equities fund, known as RIEF, inching up 0.59 percent last month.

"DETROIT, June 7 (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra on Tuesday said she believes self-driving vehicles should keep steering wheels and brakes and accelerators in them as the technology develops. “We think that having that capability when the steering wheel and the pedals are still in the vehicle is a very good way to demonstrate and prove the safety,” Barra told reporters before the company’s annual meeting at its Detroit headquarters. Alphabet Inc’s Google has proposed doing away with the steering wheels in autonomous vehicles because once developed they may not need them. IHS Automotive on Tuesday issued a report that estimates that by 2035, there will be 21 million autonomous vehicles in the world. (bit.ly/1UnIKO6) Barra also praised the company’s record profit in 2015 and reiterated that the company would be at the forefront in the evolution of the auto industry toward autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing. GM said that 2016 profit will be improved from last year’s record. During the meeting, Barra defended GM’s emphasis on retail auto sales in the U.S. market, which are direct sales to consumers, and its de-emphasis on low-profit sales to rental agencies. The practice has led to fewer overall sales. GM’s market share has slipped to 16.6 percent in the first five months of this year compared with 17.7 percent for the same period in 2015. “All share is not created equal,” Barra said. Shareholders on Tuesday approved a slate of a dozen for the No. 1 U.S. automaker’s board of directors, including Barra, who is also chairman of that board. One new member, Jane Mendillo, 57, former president and chief executive officer of Harvard Management Company, which manages the endowment of Harvard University, was voted to the board. She replaces outgoing board member Steve Girsky, who joined the board in 2009 and did not seek re-election.

The pair said in a joint statement the panel has been investigating the largest cable and satellite TV companies for more than a year, looking at potential barriers to competition in the industry, “including the difficulties faced by companies attempting to create innovative new television delivery models.” The committee has also been examining billing, fees, refunds and other customer service issues. “We believe our hearing will be a big step forward for consumers, allowing them to understand how their TV providers really work and make informed decisions about their video service,” the pair said.

The hearing follows a Federal Communications Commission proposal to allow consumers to swap pricey cable and other pay TV boxes for cheaper devices and apps, a change that would boost competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. The proposal would let customers get video services from providers like Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo Inc. It set off a lobbying battle between tech companies eager to tap into the market and cable and TV companies which could lose billions of dollars in rental fees.

The pair said in a joint statement the panel has been investigating the largest cable and satellite TV companies for more than a year, looking at potential barriers to competition in the industry, “including the difficulties faced by companies attempting to create innovative new television delivery models.” The committee has also been examining billing, fees, refunds and other customer service issues. “We believe our hearing will be a big step forward for consumers, allowing them to understand how their TV providers really work and make informed decisions about their video service,” the pair said. The senators noted that a recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey found pay television service ranked near the bottom of the 43 industries surveyed - a year after the pay-TV industry tied for the lowest score among all industries ranked. The hearing comes as the Federal Communications Commission has proposed allowing consumers to swap pricey cable and other pay TV boxes for cheaper devices and apps, a change that would boost competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. The new proposed rule, unveiled by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in January, would allow customers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo Inc, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers. The proposal has set off a frenzied lobbying battle pitting a tech industry eager to tap into the lucrative market against cable and TV companies, which could lose billions of dollars in rental fees for set-top boxes. The FCC says 99 percent of U.S. customers now must get their boxes from their cable companies, and they pay on average $231 a year to lease the devices. Cable companies say the video marketplace is already evolving as more customers replace traditional pay TV services with streaming Internet video.

"June 13 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is expected to show off new abilities for its Siri digital assistant on Monday by debuting tools to let developers work with the company’s artificial intelligence. Apple’s iPhone sales have begun to level off and it is turning increasingly to services for growth. Key to that is satisfying developers of apps, who want more from Apple: high on their list is better use of Siri. Apple has been working on letting Siri work directly with applications created by outside developers and hopes to have such tools ready in time for its Worldwide Developer Conference, technology publication The Information has reported. Apple hopes to expand Siri’s capabilities well beyond Apple apps and searching the Web. An example might be to allow the personal assistant to book a ride through a ride-hailing app listed in Apple’s App Store. “What you are seeing is just a lack of enthusiasm around apps,” said analyst Brian Blau of tech research company Gartner. “If a developer can get access to their customer wherever they are, whatever device they are on, that would be the best situation.” Siri is the most visible aspect of Apple’s artificial intelligence program, or AI. Rivals such as Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google are investing heavily in their own digital assistants, analysts say. The Worldwide Developers Conference gives Apple a chance to show off its technical prowess. “Apple just can’t stand still in light of this competition,” said analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies. A spokesman for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple acknowledged a number of developers’ grievances this month by allowing ads in App Store search results, which gives them a way to stand out in a sea of apps. And it will give developers a bigger cut of revenues on subscription apps. In addition to mending fences with developers, Apple may use the conference to unveil a makeover for Apple Music, the music streaming product it released last year, analysts say. The service has attracted millions of paying subscribers, but many customers complain that the interface is confusing, and it has few features to differentiate it from rival services, said analyst Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies.

Gill Pratt, Toyota Executive Technical Advisor and CEO of Toyota Research Institute, speaks during an group interview in Tokyo, Japan June 17, 2016. REUTERS/Toru HanaiGill Pratt, CEO of recently set up Toyota Research Institute (TRI), the Japanese automaker’s research and development company that focuses on AI, said it aims to improve car safety by enabling vehicles to anticipate and avoid potential accident situations. Toyota has said the institute will spend $1 billion over the next five years, as competition to develop self-driving cars intensifies. Earlier this month, home rival Honda Motor Co said it was setting up a new research body which would focus on artificial intelligence, joining other global automakers which are investing in robotics research, including Ford and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). “Some of the things that are in car safety, which is a near-term priority, I’m very confident that we will have some advances come out during the next five years,” Pratt told reporters late last week in comments embargoed for Monday. The concept of allowing vehicles to think, act and take some control from drivers to perform evasive maneuvers forms a key platform of Toyota’s efforts to produce a car which can drive automatically on highways by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. While currently driver assistance systems largely use image sensors to avoid obstacles including vehicles and pedestrians within the car’s lane, Pratt said TRI was looking at AI solutions to enable “the car to be evasive beyond the one lane”. “The intelligence of the car would figure out a plan for evasive action ... Essentially (it would) be like a guardian angel, pushing on the accelerators, pushing on the steering wheel, pushing on the brake in parallel with you.” As Japanese automakers race against technology companies to develop automated vehicles, they are also grappling with a rapidly graying society, which puts future demand for private vehicle ownership at risk. Pratt said he saw the possibility that Toyota may one day become a maker of robots to help the elderly. Asked of the potential for Toyota to produce robots for use in the home, he said: “That’s part of what we’re exploring at TRI.” Pratt declined to comment on a media report earlier this month that Toyota is in talks with Google’s parent company Alphabet to acquire Boston Dynamics and Schafts, both of which are robotics divisions of the technology company.

"LONDON (Reuters) - An Uber [UBER.UL] driver told a British tribunal on Wednesday he had earned less than the minimum wage, despite the firm saying he received nearly three times as much, in a case that could threaten the app’s business model. An Uber representative registers people on his smartphone during the kick off of a citywide jobs tour in the Queens borough of New York July 21, 2015.  REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Lawyers are representing two drivers at an employment tribunal, arguing that Uber is acting unlawfully by not offering rights such as holiday and sick pay. Uber, which allows users to book and pay for a taxi by smartphone, says its more than 30,000 London drivers enjoy the flexibility of being able to work when they choose and receive on average much more than the minimum wage. The case could hit Uber’s reliance on using self-employed drivers. James Farrar, a driver with the firm since December 2014, said that last August he earned less than the 6.70 pounds ($8.80) an hour for those aged 21 and older which was then the rate for the minimum wage in Britain. “They claim that, based on the total number of hours logged into the app, I have been paid 13.77 pounds on an average hourly basis,” he wrote in a witness statement. “I calculated my net earnings for August 2015 after the expenses I set off and they came to 5.03 pounds an hour.” Uber’s lawyer David Reade said that Farrar had picked a month in which he had logged onto the app for the longest period of time but canceled or not accepted the most amount of jobs, thereby reducing his hourly pay. Most employees in Britain are entitled to the minimum wage but the self-employed are among those who do not qualify. The issue of low pay and a lack of job security has sparked a public outcry in Britain in recent years with firms such as sports retailer Sports Direct facing a backlash over their use of zero-hour contracts. Last year Uber, whose investors include Goldman Sachs and Alphabet Inc unit Google, said its drivers received average payments of 16 pounds an hour in October after the firm’s service fee. The former start-up has grown rapidly and is valued at $62.5 billion but has faced protests, bans and restrictions in several cities, including in London where traditional black-cab drivers tried to have the app ruled illegal.

"(Reuters) - Yahoo Inc YHOO.O is focusing on U.S. telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) as the buyer of its core business after reviewing final bids that it received this week, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. A deal would boost Verizon’s AOL internet business, which the company acquired last year for $4.4 billion, by giving it access to Yahoo’s advertising technology tools, as well other assets such as search, mail, messenger and real estate. These synergies have made Verizon the favorite among industry analysts to prevail in the auction. The sale would also mark the end of Yahoo as an operating company, leaving it only as the owner of a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, as well as its 15 percent interest in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). Those two stakes account for most of Yahoo’s $37 billion market capitalization. Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value, but negotiations between the two companies are continuing, and no agreement has yet been reached, the sources said. Yahoo would like to have a deal for the core assets by the end of July, one of the sources added. Bloomberg News, which reported earlier that Verizon was nearing an agreement to buy the Yahoo assets, cited an anonymous source as saying the companies were discussing a price close to $5 billion. Yahoo shares were up 0.6 percent at $39.09 in morning trading, while Verizon rose 1.3 percent to $56.09. The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Verizon and Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment. “Verizon has always been the favorite because it has the largest potential synergies and therefore can pay the most,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. “The price negotiations still can be tough because it also doesn’t need Yahoo. It can put its money into its AOL franchise.” A Yahoo logo is displayed on a monitor in this photo illustration in Encinitas, California, April 16, 2013. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its go90 ad-supported mobile video service targeted at millennials. The app, which was introduced in October, offers videos from Comedy Central, Vice and other programmers, as well as basketball and football games. Other bidders for the Yahoo assets include Verizon rival AT&T (T.N); a consortium led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital LP; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners, sources have said previously. AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community. Analysts say it is unlikely that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer who has struggled to turn her internet company around, would join him at AOL. LOSING GROUND TO COMPETITORS In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis. It instead decided to explore a sale of its core assets, spurred on by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP. Yahoo said in April that Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith and three independent directors associated with him would join its board immediately. All four were on a slate that Starboard had proposed to oust Yahoo’s entire board. Started in 1994 by Stanford graduate students Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo in its early years was the destination of choice for many making their first forays into the World Wide Web. The company soared and then crashed in the first dot-com bubble before emerging as one of the few internet companies with substantial revenues and profits. The ticker and trading information for Verizon is displayed on a screen at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. June 9, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidBy 2008, Yahoo was fending off a contentious takeover bid from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and struggling to define its mission. That question was never really answered, leading to years of management instability and shifting priorities. Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O. and a host of new companies, meanwhile, claimed much of the territory that might have been Yahoo’s.

"(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc and e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc capped a blockbuster June quarter for the five biggest U.S. tech companies as their dominance in key markets helped them defy the “law of large numbers”. A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this photo illustration taken in Berlin, August 11, 2015. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc, as well as Alphabet and Amazon, all blew past Wall Street expectations for both profit and revenue. “The results are further indications that the leaders in their respective spaces are taking market shares and it is very much a microcosm of the internet as a whole,” Benchmark Company analyst Daniel Kurnos told Reuters. At some point, Kurnos said, the fact that the companies have grown so large will catch up with them. “But I think people still continue to underestimate how large the addressable opportunity is,” he said. Alphabet’s Class A shares rose 4.9 percent in early trading on Friday, boosting the company’s market value by about $23 billion to $542 billion. Amazon rose 1.8 percent, pushing up its market capitalization by about $6 billion to around $361 billion. Together, the five companies would add about $346 billion to their combined value - roughly the gross domestic product of Egypt - if they were to trade at analysts’ median price targets. Alphabet - which competes with all of the other four companies in either advertising, cloud computing, or operating systems - showed that efforts to push its vast ad business toward mobile were paying off, calming fears that the company’s best days were behind it. “How many other almost $100 billion revenue companies are accelerating growth rates to their strongest level in years?,” Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter said in a research note. Ad revenue from its Google business, which accounts for 89 percent of total revenue, jumped 19.5 percent to $19.14 billion. Google also houses the company’s Android business that competes with iOS from Apple, which sold more iPhones than analysts expected in the latest quarter. Alphabet’s ad sales numbers, and the stellar ad revenue growth that Facebook reported on Wednesday, underscored the shift in ad dollars to mobile devices from television. The leading social media company’s wildly popular mobile app and push into video attracted new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to spend more. SMOKIN’ While Google still controls nearly a third of the roughly $187 billion global digital-ad market, Facebook’s share has risen to 12 percent so far this year, from 8.6 percent in 2014, according to market research firm eMarketer. Alphabet’s other businesses, including cloud, through which it competes with Microsoft and Amazon, also held their own. “Alphabet smoked Q2 expectations, including revenue upside and a further exhibition of its new passion for expense control,” Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said in a note. Wilson, who has an “overweight” rating on the company’s stock, raised his price target to $960 from $910. Of 50 analysts covering the company, 19 raised their price targets on Alphabet’s class A stock, which has a median price target of $907. Goldman Sachs was the most bullish, raising its target by $120 to $930. All but three of the brokerages covering the stock rate it “buy” or above. None has a sell. Alphabet’s non-ad revenue jumped 33 percent to $2.17 billion, largely driven by cloud. While the pace of growth in Amazon’s cloud business slowed, revenue jumped 58 percent to $2.9 billion. Microsoft’s revenue in what it calls its “intelligent cloud” businesses, which includes the Azure cloud platform and server software, rose 7 percent to $6.7 billion. Amazon remains the undisputed leader in cloud computing, although Microsoft, under Satya Nadella, and Alphabet are both nipping at its heels. Amazon’s global retail sales also beat estimates in the quarter. “The long-term growth outlook is upbeat, as Amazon slowly takes away traditional retail’s last competitive advantage - instant gratification - and rides the AWS cloud secular growth theme,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016.

A GlaxoSmithKline logo is seen outside one of its buildings in west London, February 6, 2008. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File PhotoVerily Life Sciences - known as Google’s life sciences unit until last year - and Britain’s biggest drugmaker will together contribute 540 million pounds ($715 million) over seven years to Galvani Bioelectronics, they said on Monday. The new company, owned 55 percent by GSK and 45 percent by Verily, will be based at GSK’s Stevenage research center north of London, with a second research hub in South San Francisco. It is GSK’s second notable investment in Britain since the country voted to leave the European Union in June. Last week it announced plans to spend 275 million pounds on drug manufacturing. Galvani will develop miniaturized, implantable devices that can modify electrical nerve signals. The aim is to modulate irregular or altered impulses that occur in many illnesses. GSK believes chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis and asthma could be treated using these tiny devices, which consist of a electronic collar that wraps around nerves. Kris Famm, GSK’s head of bioelectronics research and president of Galvani, said the first bioelectronic medicines using these implants to stimulate nerves could be submitted for regulatory approval by around 2023. “We have had really promising results in animal tests, where we’ve shown we can address some chronic diseases with this mechanism, and now we are bringing that work into the clinic,” he told Reuters. “Our goal is to have our first medicines ready for regulatory approval in seven years.” GSK first unveiled its ambitions in bioelectronics in a paper in the journal Nature three years ago and believes it is ahead of Big Pharma rivals in developing medicines that use electrical impulses rather than traditional chemicals or proteins. The tie-up shows the growing convergence of healthcare and technology. Verily already has several other medical projects in the works, including the development of a smart contact lens in partnership with the Swiss drugmaker Novartis that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes. GRAIN OF RICE Famm said the first generation of implants coming to market would be around the size of a medical pill but the aim eventually was to make them as small or smaller than a grain of rice, using the latest advances in nanotechnology. Patients will be treated with keyhole surgery and the hope is that bioelectronic medicine could provide a one-off treatment, potentially lasting decades. Major challenges including making the devices ultra low-power so that they function reliably deep inside the body. The idea of treating serious disease with electrical impulses is not completely new. Large-scale electrical devices have been used for years as heart pacemakers and, more recently, deep brain stimulation has been applied to treat Parkinson’s disease and severe depression, while EnteroMedics last year won U.S. approval for a device to help obese people control their appetite. Galvani, however, is taking electrical interventions to the micro level, using tiny implants to coax insulin from cells to treat diabetes, for example, or correct muscle imbalances in lung diseases. Galvani will initially employ around 30 scientists, engineers and clinicians. The company will be chaired by Moncef Slaoui, GSK’s vaccines head, who pioneered the drugmaker’s drive into the bioelectronics field. Slaoui is retiring from GSK next March but will continue to steer Galvani after that date, a spokesman said. Galvani will be fully consolidated in GSK’s financial statements, following the model of the group’s majority-owned ViiV Healthcare business, which sells HIV medicines.

"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc venture capital arm GV said Bill Maris, a leading voice in the venture industry, is leaving the investment firm he founded and ran as chief executive for close to eight years. Bill Maris, president and chief executive officer of Google Ventures, speaks about the future during the Wall Street Journal Digital Live (WSJDLive) conference at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach, California October 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, said Friday that Maris would be replaced by managing partner David Krane. “Bill Maris has decided to step down to take a break with his family and tackle something new,” GV said in a statement. Krane has been at Google for nearly 17 years, starting as the company’s first communications director. GV, founded in 2009, pioneered a new style of corporate venture capital, making big bets on bleeding-edge technology such as commercial drones and 3D printing, and new business models such as ride-services company Uber and genetics testing firm 23andMe. Unlike many corporate venture arms, GV rarely invests in a startup that is acquired by its corporate affiliate. Just six of GV’s 320 or so investments have been acquired by Google, a spokeswoman said. It has roughly $1.4 billion under management, with many companies now worth several billions of dollars. Its investment in online retailer Jet.com paid off this week when Wal-Mart announced it would acquire the company for about $3 billion. It has also had its share of failures, such as messaging app Secret’s demise last year. But GV has slowed its pace of investments dramatically over the last year and a half. The firm made just 34 investments in 2015 compared to 63 in 2014, a 46 percent drop, according to venture capital database CB Insights. Maris had been vocal in encouraging richly valued startups to go public rather than continuing to exploit the booming private markets, and depriving employees and early investors the chance to cash out their shares. Alphabet has added other investment vehicles since GV. Google Capital, a growth-stage investment fund, launched in 2014, and Google began making investments from its balance sheet over the last couple of years. However, GV’s pace of investments still outpaced the others, according to CB Insights. Maris’s exit is the latest in a string of high-profile departures from Alphabet. Chris Urmson, chief technical officer for its self-driving car project, left last week, while Anthony Levandowski, product manager for the program, left earlier this year to co-found a startup. Tony Fadell, a well-known Silicon Valley executive who was once expected to play a central role in Alphabet’s hardware efforts, stepped down as chief executive of its Nest unit in June.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Managers of BlackRock Inc’s largest mutual fund are warning that U.S. stocks may “disappoint” investors, a company note showed on Wednesday, arguing for a shift to Japanese stocks as one of the few markets offering a bargain. The BlackRock logo is seen outside of its offices in New York January 18, 2012. B REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo Nearly 10 percent of the $45 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund was made up of Japanese stocks, as of July 29, about double the 5 percent held by its benchmark, a BlackRock website showed. The fund has wide latitude to invest across stocks, bonds and other assets. “During the month of July, we added to Japanese equities as we view the reappointment of (Japanese Prime Minister) Shinzo Abe’s coalition combined with attractive valuations and corporate governance trends as a positive for risk assets in Japan,” a note from the funds’ managers said. “Looking across the broad array of asset classes globally, few are unambiguously cheap. Investors with a strong U.S. bias may become particularly disappointed.” The note argues that U.S. stocks are priced at “valuations” that are “extended by most measures,” meaning they likely are not a bargain. U.S. equities nonetheless represent nearly a third of the fund’s portfolio, consisting of stocks the note says are a good “long-term value.” The fund’s top holdings include Apple Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Marathon Petroleum Corp. By contrast, the note said Japanese equities are below their historical averages, citing an internal BlackRock analysis, and seem especially cheap compared to emerging markets, U.S. and European stocks. In U.S. dollar terms, the MSCI Japan Index is up 8.6 percent since the end of June. Abe and his ruling coalition won a landslide victory last month in an election for parliament’s upper house. The prime minister is known for promoting an ambitious stew of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and other economic reforms. New York-based BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager. Institutional shares of its Global Allocation Fund have returned -0.57 percent over the last year, through July, trailing its longer-term record and 66 percent of its peers, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters research service.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google has suspended Project Ara, its ambitious effort to build what is known as a modular smartphone with interchangeable components, as part of a broader push to streamline the company’s hardware efforts, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Prototype modular parts created by Yezz Mobile for Project Ara, Google's modular smartphone project, are shown during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona March 1, 2015. REUTERS/Gustau Nacarino The move marks an about-face for the tech company, which announced a host of partners for Project Ara at its developer conference in May and said it would ship a developer edition of the product this autumn. The company’s aim was to create a phone that users could customize on the fly with an extra battery, camera, speakers or other components. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment on the matter. While Google will not be releasing the phone itself, the company may work with partners to bring Project Ara’s technology to market, potentially through licensing agreements, one of the people with knowledge of the matter said. Axing Project Ara is one of the first steps in a campaign to unify Google’s various hardware efforts, which range from Chromebook laptops to Nexus phones. Former Motorola president Rick Osterloh rejoined Google earlier this year to oversee the effort. Google sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo Group in 2014. Modular smartphones have generated great enthusiasm in the tech community for their potential to prolong the lifespan of a device and reduce electronic waste. But the devices are difficult to bring to market because their interchangeable parts make them bulky and costly to produce, said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research, adding that he was not surprised to see Google halt the project. “This was a science experiment that failed, and they are moving on,” he said. Project Ara was one of the flagship efforts of Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group, which aims to develop new devices, but it had various stops and starts. Last year, the company shelved plans to sell the modular phone in Puerto Rico with Latin American carriers.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau San Jose-based Apigee’s software helps companies’ digital services interact with apps used by customers and partners. The service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud, Diane Greene, who runs Google’s cloud computing division, said in an interview. “They are a leader in this application programming interface area,” she said. Cloud computing is the increasingly popular practise of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data. Apigee specializes in managing so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, the channels through which digital services connect when a company logs a purchase for a customer or places an order with a supplier. Google will pay Apigee shareholders $17.40 for each share, a 6.5 percent premium to the stock’s Wednesday close. Apigee’s shares were slightly above the offer price at $17.43 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading on Thursday. The company, whose customers include AT&T, Burberry Group Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and the World Bank, went public in April last year at $17 per share. Greene, a former VMware CEO, has pushed to raise Google’s profile in corporate computing since she joined last year. During her tenure, Google has streamlined engineering efforts and appointed new leadership for its cloud efforts, improving traction with clients, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company’s latest earnings call. Greene predicted that the Apigee acquisition would redouble Google’s momentum. “Our customer lists are extremely complimentary,” she said. “There’s some overlap and some areas where we are going to be able to help each other once [the deal] closes.” The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc said they would partner to enable Box’s corporate customers to integrate Google’s suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp and others are vying for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business. Apigee, with high-profile clients in a strategically important area, will help Google close in on the competition, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “Google has fallen behind both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing, and this move is intended to strengthen that position,” he wrote in an email.

Sanofi said last year it was working on a partnership with Google in diabetes. “The company will leverage Verily’s (formerly Google Life Sciences) experience in miniaturised electronics, analytics, and consumer software development, and Sanofi’s clinical expertise and experience in bringing innovative treatments to people living with diabetes,” the two companies said on Monday. Nearly 400 million people worldwide have diabetes, with the type 2 version accounting for more than 90 percent of cases. Without proper treatment or lifestyle changes, those numbers are expected to grow substantially in the coming years. The JV, called Onduo, “will initially focus on the type 2 diabetes community, specifically on developing solutions that could help people make better decisions about their day to day health, ranging from improved medication management to improved habits and goals,” Sanofi and Verily said. A spokeswoman for Sanofi said products on sale would include connected objects such as insulin pens and online services. No financial details were disclosed but the spokeswoman said Sanofi had invested $248 million in the joint venture, in which the French group controls a 50 percent stake.

Japan’s government has placed renewed focus on the technology industry after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made investment in cutting edge technology a central part of his economic growth strategy.

"BANGKOK/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Thailand is studying plans to toughen tax collection rules for internet and technology firms like Alphabet Inc’s Google, the head of the Revenue Department told Reuters, as the tax affairs of these firms comes under growing scrutiny in Southeast Asia. A man holds his smartphone which displays the Google home page, in this picture illustration taken in Bordeaux, Southwestern France, August 22, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau The plans would also cover the mobile transfers and internet payment sector, Prasong Poontaneat, director general of Thailand’s Revenue Department, told Reuters. Thailand is focused on changing existing regulations, Prasong said, adding that a working committee had been set up to find solutions on tax collection for companies such as Google and other technology firms. “We are studying this issue and have set up a committee to look into this over the past two months,” Prasong told Reuters. “The idea is to seek appropriate solutions for Thailand and it could involve an amendment in some regulations because current laws are outdated and have been used for more than 50 years,” said Prasong, adding that he expects the committee to come up with solutions by the end of this year. Reuters telephoned and e-mailed Google Thailand for comment, but there was no immediate reply. Google Asia Pacific’s spokesman did not immediately respond to an email and a phone call seeking comment. Indonesia is pursuing Alphabet Inc’s Google for five years of back taxes, and the U.S. search giant could face a bill of more than $400 million for 2015 alone if it is found to have avoided payments, a senior tax official told Reuters last week. Singapore’s low tax regime and its generous tax incentive programs make it a big draw for multinationals like Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp to Google, and also from other sectors, to employ regional teams there. They justify booking large revenue and profits in Singapore as they usually run main business functions such as finance and operations, hold intellectual property rights there or base regional executives in the city state. Singapore’s finance ministry said in an emailed statement last week that “profits should be taxed where activities giving rise to the profits are performed and where value is created” and that it does not condone the “artificial shifting of profits”. INVESTOR PRESSURE American business groups in the region warned that the tax crackdown risks slowing planned investments by multinationals. Investment worth millions of dollars could become stalled due to disputes with the country’s tax office, which has taken an “aggressive” approach, Lin Neumann, managing director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia, said. “There’s just been a feeling for some time among big taxpayers that they’re like the low-hanging fruits because they’re in the system,” Neumann said, noting that many multinational companies are accountable to public shareholders. The Financial Times reported on Saturday that four UK fund houses - Legal & General Investment Management, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, Royal London Asset Management and Sarasin Partners - had written to the board of Alphabet to raise concerns about its tax arrangements. In December last year, Australia’s tax office published the tax rates of every company with annual earnings over A$100 million, a move it said it would repeat annually in the hope of pressuring entities with “overly aggressive” tax structures. Apple Inc paid A$74 million tax on its A$247 million taxable income, in line with the country’s 30 percent tax rate but a small fraction of the total A$6.1 billion it made in the country that year. Google paid A$9 million tax on A$91 million in taxable income, a third of the company tax rate and dwarfed by the A$357 million it made in the country. The Australian government has since passed laws requiring consumers to pay a goods and services tax on all online purchases - not just online purchases from Australian retailers - from next year.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau MONACO (Reuters) - Google is looking to establish partnerships between insurance companies and some of its parent company Alphabet’s businesses including Nest, which makes smart thermostats and smoke detectors, the managing director of its French division said. But the U.S. firm was not focusing on entering the insurance market directly, Nick Leeder added. “With some of the things we have done around Nest, we have been working with insurers in France like AXA and Allianz to develop bundles of products which blend technology and hardware with insurance,” Leeder said during a panel discussion at the reinsurance industry’s annual meeting in Monte Carlo on Tuesday. “We’re clearer about the role that we can play and what we can add, and we are looking for partners.” More than 40 percent of insurers see Google as a potential rival and threat because of its strong brand and ability to manage customer data, a report from consultants Capgemini earlier this year found. But that was not where Google was directing its efforts. “We are not a company that uses the word never much, so it’s difficult to rule things in or out. I think there are things that we are good at and things we are not good at,” the Google France boss said. Areas Google had been focusing more on included health care, and it shut down its price comparison site for motor insurance, Google Compare, earlier this year. “We found it didn’t work as well as we’d like,” Leeder said.

"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) shares plunged on Thursday as fears mounted that a much-anticipated auction of the social media company will draw minimal interest from potential buyers. With stagnant user growth and continuing losses, Twitter’s board agreed last month to consider a sale, and has told potential acquirers it wants such deliberations to conclude by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Technology website Recode reported later on Wednesday that Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O), long considered the most logical buyer for Twitter, and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) would not bid for the social network, leaving cloud software company Salesforce.com (CRM.N) as the only known suitor. Twitter shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to $20.10, valuing the company at about $14.2 billion. They closed 20.1 percent lower at $19.87. Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff has publicly expressed his interest in Twitter in recent days, but stopped short of saying the company had decided on a bid. Analysts said he downplayed the possibility in a meeting with investors on Wednesday, sending Salesforce shares up about 4 percent. “I’m not saying I’m buying it, but I’m not saying I’m not buying it,” Benioff said on Wednesday in an interview with the New York Times. Even at $20, Twitter shares are well above the $14 they were trading at before speculation about a possible acquisition began to emerge this spring. Many investors and analysts believe Twitter remains expensive for most potential buyers, but the company does not have a clear back-up plan if it is not acquired. Product initiatives under CEO Jack Dorsey, who returned to the company a year ago but also remains CEO of payment company Square, have borne little fruit. Large amounts of employee stock and options are also considered an obstacle for some potential bidders. Slideshow (2 Images)The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about $11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another $9.50 from the stock. Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has also been rumored as a possible bidder, though Recode reported that Apple would not move forward.

"(Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) is still deliberating whether it should make an offer for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) in the face of resistance from Salesforce shareholders over the strategic merits and valuation of such a deal, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Twitter shares have lost as much as a third of their value since Oct. 5 on concerns the company has attracted less interest from potential acquirers than previously envisaged. It now has a market capitalization of $12 billion. Salesforce is deliberating whether it is worth making a lowball offer for Twitter in the coming days based on Twitter’s stock performance and any news of other bidders, the people said. Other potential acquirers such as Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) have backed away from making offers for the Internet company, the people said. There may however be other companies contemplating offers for Twitter whose identity has not yet been reported, some of the sources suggested. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Salesforce declined to comment while Twitter, Google and Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters previously reported that Twitter aimed to conclude deliberations about selling itself by Oct. 27, when it reports its third-quarter earnings. Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software. Unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at business users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships. A potential acquisition of Twitter has weighed down Salesforce’s stock since news broke on Sept. 23 that it was vying for Twitter. Its shares rose as much as 7 percent on Monday after a weekend report by Bloomberg News suggested Salesforce was unlikely to make an offer. A Salesforce sign is seen during the company's annual Dreamforce event, in San Francisco, California November 18, 2013. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Some analysts and investors have questioned why Salesforce would need to own Twitter, when it already licenses the Twitter “firehose” for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. At Salesforce’s annual client conference last week, Benioff said Salesforce considers buying many companies but maintains discipline, and wished Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey “well.” These comments tamped out expectations that Salesforce would be an aggressive bidder for Twitter. Since its founding a decade ago, Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news.

(bloom.bg/2dAlT7J) Twitter’s shares plunged about 20 percent over the final two days of last week after technology website Recode reported that Google, Disney and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) were not interested in the company, which put itself up for potential sale last month. Twitter’s stock fell to $17.21 on Monday, the lowest in more than two months. At that price, the company has a market value of $12.18 billion, compared with almost $53 billion at its peak in December 2013. Salesforce shares rose 5.3 percent to $74.65. Analysts and investors had raised concerns that a takeover of Twitter could severely hit the cloud software maker’s market value.

Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as interim CEO in July 2015 and became permanent chief executive last October, has made a big push into live video, signing deals with a number of media companies and sports organizations to stream major events such as the presidential debates and Thursday Night NFL games.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Headhunters are trying to lure Italian bankers in London back to jobs at home, hoping to use Britain’s vote to leave the EU as leverage to fill a string of vacancies at investment banks in Europe’s fourth largest economy. A couple walks past a Barclays branch in downtown Rome May 8, 2014. REUTERS/Max Rossi American, British, French and Japanese investment banks are looking for a total of six dealmakers to head their businesses in Italy after a number of senior bankers jumped ship for top jobs at Italian corporates. Bank of America’s (BAC.N) chief executive in Italy Marco Morelli, Nomura’s (8604.T) top Italian banker Francesco Mele and Barclays’ (BARC.L) Italy head Alessandra Pasini have all ditched investment banking for executive corporate jobs. Senior staff in Italy have also left Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and HSBC (HSBA.L) in recent months, sources told Reuters, while BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is interviewing candidates to head the corporate division of its Italian subsidiary Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). The banks declined to comment on their hiring plans. Since the start of the financial crisis, life in companies outside the financial sector has become increasingly attractive for senior bankers, whose jobs now involve dealing more with restructuring plans, cutting costs and compliance work. “At a certain stage in your career, if you’re being offered a prestigious corporate role, it’s hard to refuse,” said Anna Marietta, a partner at executive search firm DHR International. Goldman Sachs rainmaker Simon Dingemans joined British drug firm GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) as chief financial officer (CFO) in 2011, Goldman’s Anthony Noto left the bank in 2014 to become Twitter’s (TWTR.N) CFO while Morgan Stanley’s (MS.N) Ruth Porat became CFO at Google’s holding firm Alphabet (GOOGL.O) in 2015. MUSICAL CHAIRS The vacancies in Italy come at a crucial time for investment banks in the country as they battle for lucrative work helping lenders Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) raise billions of euros in capital. “There is an unprecedented game of musical chairs in the Italian investment banking industry,” said a senior Italian banker who is in the running for some of the top jobs. “We’re seeing a high number of talented investment bankers moving on to corporate life but big banks remain committed to Italy,” he told Reuters. Still, finding the right people for such senior roles in Italy can be tough, as many Italian bankers tend to base themselves in London where there is a wider variety of work, as well as better tax rates. For example, just 1 percent of the top five U.S. banks’ European workforces were based in Italy in 2014, according to think-tank Bruegel, despite the country being the fourth biggest fee-earner in Europe for banks. For those major U.S. lenders, 88 percent of their European staff were based in Britain. But with investment banks expected to start moving staff across Europe following the Brexit vote, recruitment consultants say there may now be more incentives for Italians to relocate to the country’s financial capital in Milan. “Brexit could be a facilitating factor,” said DHR International’s Marietta. “The UK is changing, psychologically it could play a role.” Italy is home to some of the biggest fee payers in Europe. Ailing lender Monte dei Paschi paid banks more than 400 million euros ($438 million) for two capital increases in as many years and is now working on an expensive rescue plan. Bankers say this means Italy remains an attractive market to enter and U.S. investment bank Jefferies [JGLL.UL] recently started operations in Milan. It has just hired Mauro Premazzi from Bank of America and is seeking to establish a foothold before expanding its Italian team, the sources said. A spokeswoman at Jefferies declined to comment. CHALLENGING TIMES Headhunters will, nevertheless, have their work cut out as the list of recent departures in Italy is long. Societe Generale’s group country head in Italy Patrizia Micucci stepped down in July while HSBC’s head of global banking for Italy, Stefano Giudici, who was responsible for investment and corporate banking in the country, left in September. A Societe Generale spokesman confirmed Micucci was no longer with the bank, adding that Roberto Pecora, head of Societe Generale’s market activities in Italy, has been managing its corporate and investment banking activities in the country on an interim basis since July 28. French rival BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is looking to hire a new head for BNL’s corporate division as it wants to develop closer ties with small- and mid-sized corporate clients served by BNL, the sources said. Bank of America and Nomura, whose top bankers Morelli and Mele became Monte dei Paschi’s chief executive and chief financial officer, have instructed headhunters to find candidates for their Italian businesses, the sources said. Societe Generale is also working with headhunters and its recruitment process is more advanced than at Barclays, which is still digesting the departure of Alessandra Pasini, who became CFO at Italian utility Snam (SRG.MI) on Sept. 27. Earlier this year, Barclays hired veteran Italian dealmaker Carlo Calabria as chairman of mergers and acquisitions for Europe, Middle East and Africa, bringing eight of his colleagues from CMC Capital, the boutique advisory firm he set up. Two of the sources said the British bank may select its new Italy head from Calabria’s team but cautioned that no final decision had been made. Bank of America’s Diego De Giorgi, who was recently made sole head of global investment banking, will have the final word on the selection of its new Italy chief, which is seen as the most prestigious job with possibly an additional role up for grabs as head of investment banking Italy. Still, running the Italian franchise of a large international bank comes with the challenge of delivering ambitious growth targets in a largely flat market, even if there is money to be made with lenders such as Monte dei Paschi. Investment banking fees in Italy were down nearly 30 percent last year to $1.28 billion, reflecting a more general slump in banking fees worldwide.

"(Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff spoke on Wednesday about a pair of key acquisitions that got away, suggesting his vision for LinkedIn Corp LNKD.N was different from Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) and that he would have pursued Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) if shareholders had not learned of his plans. Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of Salesforce, speaks at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S., October 26, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake Speaking at a technology conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal in Laguna Beach, California, Benioff declined to elaborate on what he had hoped to do with micro-blogging site Twitter. Twitter hired bankers earlier in October to explore selling itself. Technology and media companies including Salesforce.com, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google looked at the company but passed on buying it. Some regarded Twitter as an unlikely fit for Salesforce.com, whose platform is popular among sales teams. Benioff said he was forced to drop the deal when investors began voicing concerns. “We’ve never had a deal leak before; we don’t really understand that dynamic,” said Benioff, who is an avid Twitter user. “We had to stop because I’m running the business in partnership with my shareholders.” Benioff was also effusive about his interest in professional social networking site LinkedIn, which Microsoft agreed to buy for $26.2 billion in June. Benioff told technology news website Recode in June that Salesforce.com made a bid for LinkedIn and was primarily interested in its recruiting business. Benioff on Wednesday said he saw parallels between Salesforce.com’s business model and LinkedIn’s. “We really liked some of the business fundamentals,” he said, adding few details on his vision for an acquisition of LinkedIn. He contrasted that vision with Microsoft’s, which he said centered on mingling the companies’ data streams to make it difficult for other companies to compete. Salesforce.com has raised concerns about the deal to European antitrust regulators. “Last time I checked, that was illegal,” he said of Microsoft’s plans for LinkedIn’s data. Microsoft said it was confident it would gain final regulatory approval for the LinkedIn acquisition by the end of 2016. “We’re committed to continuing to work to bring price competition to a CRM (customer relationship management) market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices,” a Microsoft spokesman said in an emailed statement.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google (GOOGL.O) on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines. A man holds his smartphone which displays the Google home page, in this picture illustration taken in Bordeaux, Southwestern France, August 22, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau The U.S. technology giant’s rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and a host of European and U.S. rivals. The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time. Google’s general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company’s actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals. “We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn’t ‘favoring’ - that’s listening to our customers,” Walker said. He said the Commission had failed to take into account competition from Amazon (AMZN.O), merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by companies such as Facebook (FB.O) and Pinterest. The EU executive said it had received Google’s response. “In each case, we will carefully consider Google’s response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,” Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School. “Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point,” he said. Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as anti-competitive. The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion or 10 percent of the company’s global turnover for each case. Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so.

"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish firm Tobii on Monday announced plans to raise 450 million crowns ($50 million) in a rights issue to invest in technology for virtual reality and smartphones. The company’s eye-tracking technology helps disabled people use computers by identifying where they are looking on their screens. “The interest for eye tracking in various consumer applications has developed at a substantially more rapid pace than we anticipated at the time of the IPO in April 2015,” it said in a statement. It said it would use the money to build up market-leading positions in virtual reality and smartphones. Dell, Acer and MSI have already released computers that integrate Tobii’s eye-tracking sensors, and some 40 games with support for Tobii’s technology have been launched. The firm said a large smartphone maker has chosen its technology for one smartphone model. Tobii’s system uses invisible infra-red light to illuminate the eyes. Camera sensors capture the reflection off the retina and cornea to gauge where the eye is, and where it is looking. In a sign of the technology’s increasing importance, Alphabet Inc’s Google bought eye-tracking firm Eyefluence last month. Tobii said shareholders representing approximately 40 percent of its voting rights have already expressed support for the rights issue. Assuming it is approved, Tobii plans to invest approximately 150 million crowns in virtual reality and another 150 million in smartphone technology between 2017 and 2019. Shares in Tobii are trading roughly flat year to date but are up almost 170 percent since going public.

"A man holds Apple smartphone outside an Apple store in Beijing, China, September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Thomas Peter (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is considering expanding into wearable glass headsets and has talked about the project with potential suppliers, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. The wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report. Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. Apple, the world’s largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. Apple declined to comment. The move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. Snap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week.

The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) said it had sought the data about the company’s equal opportunity program in September 2015.

As a federal contractor, Google must agree to permit the federal government to inspect and copy records and information relevant to its compliance with the equal employment laws administered by OFCCP.

"(Repeats to additional subscriber services, no change to text) MILAN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Italy’s tax authorities are looking at a proposal from Alphabet Inc’s Google to pay between 270 million and 280 million euros ($286-296 million) to settle a tax dispute, a source close to the matter said on Tuesday. A year ago Italian tax police alleged that Google had evaded paying taxes worth 227 million euros between 2009 and 2013 in a move which was said could result in heavy punitive fines. Governments across Europe are looking for ways to change tax rules which allow multinationals to park profits in other tax jurisdictions. Some countries, including Italy, are also trying to use existing tax rules to force companies to pay more tax on the profits generated by sales in their countries. At the end of 2015 Apple Inc agreed to pay Italy’s tax office 318 million euros to settle a dispute over allegations it failed to pay taxes for six years. “There was a meeting with Google’s lawyers just before Christmas when the proposal was presented”, the source said. But sticking points to a final settlement include working out final details on how revenues are booked for tax purposes and securing a commitment from the U.S. giant to pay taxes in Italy in the future, the source added. “Google is continuing to work with the competent authorities,” a company spokeswoman said. In January last year Google agreed to pay the British government 130 million pounds ($158 million) in back taxes in a deal which opposition parties in the country criticised as too little in view of the size of Google’s UK revenues.

Attendees wait for the program to begin during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Beck DiefenbachShares were down 1 percent at $849.40 in early trading on Friday, after hitting a record high earlier. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on Alphabet’s stock, which now has a median price target of $992.50 - indicating a 15.8 percent upside to the stock’s Thursday close. “From a capital allocation standpoint, we appreciate Alphabet is investing in strategic, promising areas like Google Assistant and hardware, while pausing investment in less rewarding areas like Fiber,” Jefferies analysts said. Alphabet still gets most of its revenue from its advertising business, which rose 17.4 percent to $22.4 billion in the quarter. “As we reflect upon longer-term trends impacting the company’s core advertising business, trends seem pretty clear with Google reinforcing its co-hegemonic position alongside Facebook (FB.O) on an ongoing basis,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser Over the past few quarters, the company has highlighted its hardware business and Other Bets, which includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo, and X, a research facility that works on “moon shot” ventures. Operating loss in Other Bets narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, while capital expenses rose to $504 million from $193 million a year earlier. “Alphabet is taking control of software and hardware which we think is necessary to ensure an optimal user experience on Android,” said Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi, who estimated that the company sold about 1.5 million Pixels, above his estimate of 1 million. Doshi also said he expects YouTube to generate $14 billion to $15 billion in gross revenue this year, making it a possible catalyst for the stock. He cut his price target by $1 to $1,024, to adjust for a slight dip in his 2017 profit expectations. Alphabet’s shares have climbed nearly 17 percent over the past twelve months. Of the 49 brokerages that cover Alphabet, 47 of them have a “buy” or higher rating. The stock trades at roughly 21 times forward earnings, compared with Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) price-to-earnings ratio of 32 and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) 22. Shares of Microsoft, which on Thursday reported a 3.6 percent rise in fiscal second-quarter profit, rose 2 percent to an all-time high of $65.64.

A man holds his smartphone which displays the Google home page, in this picture illustration taken in Bordeaux, Southwestern France, August 22, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau While advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Google’s revenue, rising 17.4 percent to $22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company’s other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 percent to $3.4 billion. “We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube,” Porat said on a call with investors. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 percent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 percent, compared to 19 percent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. “If you look above that, it’s business as usual,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. “There has been no margin compression in the actual business.” Executives suggested that they are beginning to reap the rewards of their investment in hardware. Porat spotlighted the company’s line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. “We’re committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people,” he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92 billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 percent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 percent, compared with a 33 percent increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9 percent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet’s Other Bets revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company’s research facility that works on “moon shot” ventures. Verily Life Sciences, one such bet, announced Thursday that Singapore-based investment company Temasek had invested $800 million for a minority stake in the company. The investment reflects Alphabet’s greater fiscal discipline under Porat and suggests a potential new model for the other bets, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “Getting external investors involved helps spread that risk out and reduces Google’s exposure,” he said. “It also allows some things to move faster than they would if it were just Google’s cash backing them.” Alphabet's net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella after meeting with President-elect Trump at Trump Tower. REUTERS/Shannon StapletonIn a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Microsoft President Brad Smith outlined a program for case-by-case review of exceptions to a travel ban instituted last week. Microsoft is the first major U.S. company to press the government to create a formal program that would ease the ban for foreign-born workers who do not have permanent residence in the United States. Permanent residents, known as green card holders, were granted an exemption on Sunday. The proposal argued that Kelly and Tillerson have the power to grant exceptions to the travel ban under the order issued last week by Trump. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) have been vocal in their opposition to Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world to create their products and services. Amazon and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O) filed declarations of support on Monday in a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state Attorney General. Microsoft said on Thursday that 76 of its employees and 41 dependents were affected by the travel ban. Microsoft’s proposal would cover holders of the H-1B visa, a temporary work visa that the tech sector relies on to recruit foreign talent. Kelly issued an order on Sunday saying that green card holders would be allowed to travel under the executive orders, but H-1B holders from the seven affected countries are still banned. The proposal would also allow students to travel from affected countries if they can prove they were enrolled and in good standing at a U.S. school. The letter proposed that both students and employees would not be allowed to travel to the banned countries for business reasons but could travel there for family reasons with case-by-case approval. “In short, these individuals are ‘known quantities’ in their communities: their character, personalities, conduct, and behavior is understood by their colleagues, employers, friends, and neighbors,” Microsoft’s Smith said in a blog post made at the same time the company sent its letter. Microsoft is also among several technology companies considering signing an open letter to Trump expressing concern about his ban on Syrian refugees, along with other issues such as the estimated 750,000 people brought to the United States as children whose immigration status is unclear. The letter is being circulated among tech companies and companies outside the sector, according to two sources in the industry familiar with the matter. Facebook Inc (FB.O), Apple, Google and Microsoft, along with a number of companies outside the sector, are considering signing, the sources said. Recode and Bloomberg previously reported the letter’s existence. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple and Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment.

"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump’s business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration’s immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order “and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump “understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. “In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,” he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick’s departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Uber CEO Travis Kalanick attends the summer World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China, June 26, 2016.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Managers of BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) largest mutual fund, fearing Trump administration policies could hurt technology companies with hefty foreign revenue streams, have reshuffled their top holdings, and it appears one of the first casualties is Google. The BlackRock logo is seen outside of its offices in New York January 18, 2012. B REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo Alphabet Inc (GOOG.O) has dropped out of the fund’s top-10 holdings list after the $41 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund (MALOX.O) (MCLOX.O) pared back its near-half-billion-dollar stake in the parent of the leading search engine in January. Last year, Alphabet C-class shares worth about 1 percent of the fund’s total assets were on its top-10 list. The Global Allocation Fund holds hundreds of stocks and also invests in bonds. The C-class shares have no voting rights. Alphabet’s A-class shares (GOOGL.O) were not a top-10 holding of the fund. As of Jan. 31, the list still included other tech innovators, such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Facebook Inc (FB.O), according to BlackRock’s website. Global Allocation held about $443 million in Alphabet C-class shares, as of Oct. 31, down from $550 million the prior quarter, according to regulatory filings. The fund has held the stock since October 2015, according to Morningstar Inc. The latest disclosures do not make clear how much of the Alphabet stake has been sold. The 10th-largest Global Allocation holding, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), accounted for about 0.58 percent of the fund, which would work out to $237 million, suggesting the Google stake had fallen at least to that level. Alphabet did not respond to requests for comment. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, declined to comment. “Our enthusiasm for U.S. stocks is tempered by elevated valuations, a lack of fiscal policy specifics, and uncertainty regarding future U.S. trade policy,” the fund’s managers wrote in a summary covering their January trades. “We reduced the fund’s exposure to select technology stocks, including U.S.-based companies that generate a significant portion of revenues from non-U.S. dollar sources.” Alphabet earned 53 percent of its revenue outside of the United States last year, according to its earnings statements. The value was reduced by the U.S. dollar’s strength against the British pound, euro and other currencies. U.S. President Donald Trump has touted a series of trade and tax reforms to boost domestic growth, some of which could also push up the U.S. dollar. A Republican proposal to reform taxes that would levy a 20 percent tax on imports and exclude export revenue from taxable income has been circulating. Trump has said he would announce his own tax plan in coming weeks. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Richard ChangOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

It cut its initial target of $20 billion-$25 billion last week following negative investor feedback. In a room of more than 400 investors on the 36th floor of New York’s Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Spiegel brushed aside concerns of slowing user growth and stressed Snap’s potential to change “the way people live and communicate,” according to sources who asked not to be identified because the meeting was closed to the press. Many investors remained unconvinced by Snap’s claim that it is more valuable than Facebook Inc (FB.O) based on revenue at the time of its IPO in 2012. Still, they acknowledged that Snap has built momentum as this year’s biggest technology IPO and the darling of millennials. “They could have been in their underwear up there and no one would have cared,” said one investor who attended the roadshow on Tuesday. In the Q&A with management that took up the entire session, not one attendee asked about the company’s first-of-its kind share structure that offers IPO investors no voting rights. Investors were wary that being too critical might prompt the company to limit their allocation in the offering, an investor said. Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy will have the right to 10 votes for every share, and existing investors such as venture capital backers will get one vote for each share. Investors seeking clear answers to concerns around metrics, particularly the company’s long-touted new user growth, were disappointed. New user growth slowed in the second half of 2016, and just this week Facebook’s WhatsApp introduced a disappearing photo-messaging service similar to Snapchat’s. Last year, Facebook introduced disappearing videos to its Instagram platform that resemble Snapchat’s. Spiegel said the company’s growth is “lumpy,” due to new launches that have varying degrees of success. In a recent update of its IPO registration document, the company also pointed to technical issues facing Android devices that have hindered new user growth outside the United States. Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan asked investors to gauge how much users engaged by looking at Snap’s cost of revenue. Traditionally, investors focus on metrics such as daily active users or minutes spent on the app. Slideshow (9 Images)Snap’s cost of revenue is primarily driven by how much the company has to pay to partners such as Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to support data and bandwidth. This is based on how often users engage with the app and the types of features they use. One investor saw a “huge red flag” when Snap’s leaders did not answer the question of where they see the company in five years. “There was so much hubris there it scared me away... This felt like the late technology bubble roadshows,” one of the investors said, referring to the IPO bonanza of the dot-com boom in 2000. Reporting by Lauren Hirsch and Liana B.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Waymo self-driving car unit sued Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] and its autonomous trucking subsidiary Otto on Thursday over allegations of theft of its confidential and proprietary sensor technology. Waymo accused Uber and Otto, acquired by the ride services company in August, with stealing confidential information on Waymo’s Lidar sensor technology to help speed its own efforts in autonomous technology. “Uber’s LiDAR technology is actually Waymo’s LiDAR technology,” said Waymo’s complaint in the Northern District of California. Uber said it took “the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully.” Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position on or near the road, is a crucial component of autonomous driving systems. Previous systems have been prohibitively expensive and Waymo sought to design one over 90 percent cheaper, making its Lidar technology among the company’s “most valuable assets,” Waymo said. Waymo is seeking an unspecified amount of damages and a court order preventing Uber from using its proprietary information. Otto launched with much fanfare in May, due in part to the high profile of one of its co-founders, Anthony Levandowski, who had been an executive on Google’s self-driving project. Uber acquired the company in August for what Waymo said in the lawsuit was $680 million. Waymo said that before Levandowski’s resignation in January 2016 from Google, whose self-driving unit was renamed Waymo in December, he downloaded over 14,000 confidential files, including Lidar circuit board designs, thereby allowing Uber and Otto to fast-track its self-driving technology. Waymo accused Levandowski of attempting to “erase any forensic fingerprints” via a reformat of his laptop. “While Waymo developed its custom LiDAR systems with sustained effort over many years, defendants leveraged stolen information to shortcut the process and purportedly build a comparable LiDAR system in only nine months,” the complaint said.

Waymo’s lawsuit said it learned of this use of trade secrets and patent infringement after it was inadvertently copied on an email from a component vendor that included a design of Uber’s Lidar circuit board, which bore a “striking resemblance” to Waymo’s design. Waymo noted that Google devoted over seven years to self-driving cars and said Uber’s forays into the technology through a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University had stalled by early 2016.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A company now owned by Uber last year quietly bought a small firm specializing in sensor technology used in autonomous vehicles, giving the ride services company a patent in the technology and possibly a defense against a trade secrets theft lawsuit filed against it by rival Alphabet Inc. A man arrives at the Uber offices in Queens, New York, U.S., February 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe chief executive of little-known Tyto Lidar LLC said in a May 2016 post on LinkedIn that the company had been sold, at the same time as he and three other executives joined Otto, according to their profiles on the online business network. Official U.S. patent data shows Otto acquired Tyto technology at the same time. Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded by former Alphabet employees, was bought by Uber in August. The unpublicized acquisition may become a factor in the high-stakes legal fight between Uber and Alphabet, the parent of Google, as the two Silicon Valley companies aggressively develop self-driving technology, widely seen as the future of private road transport in the United States. Equally, it may end up being a footnote in the complex litigation, which could take years to unfold. Alphabet’s autonomous car unit Waymo sued Uber and Otto last week, alleging that former employee Anthony Levandowski, who left Waymo to set up Otto, downloaded and stole more than 14,000 confidential files, including details on light detection and ranging sensor technology, known as Lidar, a crucial element in most self-driving car systems. It claimed that without those Waymo designs, Uber could not have developed its technology as fast as it says. An Uber spokesperson declined to comment on Tyto, citing the pending litigation, but called Waymo’s lawsuit “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” Waymo declined to comment on Tyto. ‘STRIKING RESEMBLANCE’ In its lawsuit, Waymo said that by mid-2016, Uber was “more than five years behind in the race to develop vehicle automation technology suitable for the mass market,” yet it built a Lidar system comparable to Waymo’s “in only nine months”. However, the acquisition of Tyto means that at least two executives with long experience in Lidar – one as early as 2009, according to his LinkedIn profile - transferred to Otto and then Uber. Both had previously worked at Velodyne, another Silicon Valley Lidar pioneer, according to LinkedIn.

Alphabet’s autonomous car unit Waymo sued Uber and Otto last week, alleging that former employee Anthony Levandowski, who left Waymo to set up Otto, downloaded and stole more than 14,000 confidential files, including details on light detection and ranging sensor technology, known as Lidar, a crucial element in most self-driving car systems. It claimed that without those Waymo designs, Uber could not have developed its technology as fast as it says. An Uber spokesperson declined to comment on Tyto, citing the pending litigation, but called Waymo’s lawsuit “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” Waymo declined to comment on Tyto. ‘STRIKING RESEMBLANCE’ In its lawsuit, Waymo said that by mid-2016, Uber was “more than five years behind in the race to develop vehicle automation technology suitable for the mass market,” yet it built a Lidar system comparable to Waymo’s “in only nine months”. However, the acquisition of Tyto means that at least two executives with long experience in Lidar – one as early as 2009, according to his LinkedIn profile - transferred to Otto and then Uber. Both had previously worked at Velodyne, another Silicon Valley Lidar pioneer, according to LinkedIn.

"(Repeats story published earlier on Monday) By Julia Love and Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO, March 6 (Reuters) - When Uber Technologies Inc was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around – and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google’s venture capital arm. Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success. On paper, the firm’s initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion. But now Alphabet Inc, Google’s corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV’s investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm’s own investors. “Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber’s admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. “We have reviewed Waymo’s claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court,” Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. “In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.” A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment. DEAL AT ANY COST Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction. With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber’s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said. They finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google’s senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board. A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone’s recent book “The Upstarts,” seemed to bode well for the relationship. But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company’s ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google’s mapping team, the person said. Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said. The friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania. It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said. “Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly,” said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights. The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board. Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview. UNDERMINED BY ITS OWN INVESTORS? Uber’s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber. Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet’s lawsuit. In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet. In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto’s - and later Uber’s - version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position. Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations. The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship. All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured. “It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, ‘Hope it goes well,’” one of the sources said.

Web companies such as Google and Facebook face increased scrutiny over how and where they store location and search history data from users of smartphones and mail accounts. “The consumer council Taenk would like the Data Protection Agency to assess whether Google’s indefinite data collection complies with consumer’s basic right to privacy,” the watchdog stated in the report seen by Reuters. “We have become aware of the fact that Google today has 9-10 years of data on users with a Google account,” the report stated. In July last year Google changed its data storage practices to comply with requests by Italy’s privacy regulator.

The group, which lodged a complaint about Google’s comparison shopping service with the European Commission about three years ago, urged the EU competition authority to take action. “Google once again, in breach of EU antitrust rules, abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators, aiming to preserve and strengthen its dominance in general internet search,” OIP said in a statement. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said the regulator would assess the complaint. Google has said Android boosts rather than hurts competition. The world’s most popular internet search engine has been in the EU crosshairs since April 2016, accused of using its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals. Regulators said such tactics include requiring smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser to get access to other Google apps. The stakes are high for Google, which makes billions from advertising sales on Android phones through its apps such as Maps, Search and Gmail. It faces a fine up to 10 percent of its global turnover and an order to end anti-competitive practices if found guilty of breaching EU rules.

"NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - Major U.S. media companies Time Warner Inc’s Turner, Viacom Inc and 21st Century Fox Inc’s Fox Networks Group will launch OpenAP, a program for advertisers to laser focus their commercials at specific audiences on television. With the TV upfront season weeks away, advertisers are seeking audiences beyond the ones measured by Nielsen, which are based on age, gender and income, mimicking ad buying on the digital side. Over the next two months, most major U.S. media companies will sell the bulk of their TV ad inventory for the next year in what is known as the upfront market. Many media companies have come up with their own ways to allow ad buyers to target audience segments, such as an automaker that only wants to reach viewers looking to buy a new car. Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal unit recently said it would sell $1 billion of its ad inventory during this year’s upfront market using its in-house Audience Targeting Platform, rather than Nielsen. Turner, Viacom and Fox say this type of media buying doesn’t work if each company uses its own set of data on its own system. Advertisers are distrustful on the digital side because major players like Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google create their own measurements, akin to grading their own homework, they say. Targeted advertising has mostly been deployed for smaller and one-time ad deals, but “each upfront we’ve been getting more interest and more negotiations on audience buying,” said Donna Speciale, Turner’s president of advertising sales. OpenAP’s goal is to allow an advertiser or an agency to define an audience segment or work with the networks to create one, then target that segment across all three companies’ TV networks. “We still handle pricing, inventory, management and negotiations separately,” said Joe Marchese, president of Advanced Ad products at Fox Networks Group. “But we now have a standard definition (of a particular audience segment) so the client only has to do it once.” A third-party auditor will measure how many times an advertiser’s commercial runs in front of the particular audience. The three companies sent a letter about OpenAP to advertisers and agencies on Wednesday, and plan a formal event next month, where they will unveil specifics. “Our hope is that it becomes widely adopted across the TV universe,” said Sean Moran, head of marketing and partner solutions at Viacom.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European consumer protection authorities will ask social media companies Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to amend their terms of service within one month or possibly face fines, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The companies proposed some ways to resolve the issues and discussed them with the authorities on Thursday, the person said, adding that the meeting was constructive. The source was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity. U.S. technology companies have faced tight scrutiny in Europe for the way they do business, from privacy to how quickly they remove illegal or hateful content. The authorities sent letters to the companies in December saying that some of service terms broke European Union consumer protection law and that they needed to do more to tackle fraud and scams on their websites. According to the letters seen by Reuters, some of those terms include requiring users to seek redress in court in California, where the companies are based, instead of their country of residence. Other issues include not identifying sponsored content clearly, requiring consumers to waive mandatory rights such as the right to cancel a contract, and an excessive power for the companies to determine the suitability of content generated by users, according to the letters. In the case of Alphabet’s Google unit, the concerns were about its social network Google+. Google and Facebook were not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment. The authorities are being supported by the European Commission and could impose fines if they are not satisfied. The authorities also proposed setting up a standard communication channel to notify the companies of content deemed illegal and the action requested, according to the letters.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Only two years ago, an outage similar to the one that struck Amazon’s cloud services last month would have reinforced U.S. financial firms’ view that shifting data and systems onto the public cloud was just too risky. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France on February 20, 2017. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File PhotoThe fact that the Feb. 28 shutdown had no visible impact on the industry’s use of cloud services goes to show how far it has progressed since then in embracing the cloud after nearly a decade of hesitation. That change of heart came after providers Amazon Inc, Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google took steps to assure financial firms and regulators that the cloud not only made tech systems cheaper and faster, but also more reliable and secure than their own server-filled warehouses. The benefits are so unquestionable that last month’s outage caused by an employee who typed in a wrong code was barely a bump on the road to the cloud and merely a reminder that no technology is foolproof, financial executives, Silicon Valley vendors and analysts who work with them said. “You can’t just say if you use Amazon you get the magic cloud sauce and everything will work perfectly,” said Yevgeniy Brikman, the co-founder of Gruntwork, a startup that helps big companies deploy cloud services. “And similarly that if you use your own data center that somehow magically everything will work perfectly. These are just tools.” The payoffs of using the cloud are clear for an industry engaged in rounds of relentless cost-cutting. Calculations performed for Reuters by research firm IDC Financial Insights show the biggest global banks saving $15 billion by 2019 from cloud adoption, cutting technology infrastructure costs by 25 percent. About two thirds of global financial firms will be using cloud services in a significant way by next year, IDC predicts. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2nrpRoG) Developing an application on the cloud can help reduce the time it takes to launch from 89 days to 15 days, according to consultancy McKinsey & Company. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Capital One Financial Corp and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co are already using shared cloud services from large technology vendors, executives and spokespeople said. So are institutions such as Nasdaq Inc, The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the brokerage industry watchdog. State Street Corp is considering the same. Amazon is the biggest provider with 40 percent of public cloud business, according to Synergy Research. That market totaled $7 billion in the fourth quarter, and is growing at an annual rate of 50 percent. FINRA now runs 90 percent of its critical applications, including market surveillance, on Amazon’s cloud, saving $20 million annually. The recent outage did not affect its satisfaction. “The capability and flexibility to recover quickly is much greater, and it is far more cost-efficient than operating your own geographically dispersed data centers,” said spokesman Ray Pellecchia. TRUCKING DATA Cost savings alone would not have been enough to lure big financial firms. For years, the industry sat on the sidelines due to concerns about data security and regulatory compliance as other corporations took advantage of the cloud’s benefits. Silicon Valley took notice and made changes. For instance, Amazon has expanded its number and locations of data centers around the world to allow customers to choose a particular center to comply with different countries’ privacy rules. Customers can also get dedicated servers to avoid sharing them, or can access information through private networks. In late-November Amazon introduced the “Snowmobile,” a tamper-resistant 45-foot (13.72 m) container pulled by a semi-trailer truck that securely transports customers’ servers to its own data centers. Amazon customers can also set up systems to automatically shift to another data center within its 16 global regions if an outage occurs. That minimized the impact of the recent outage, four financial customers said. George Brady, who heads shared technology operations at Capital One, told Reuters the bank believed big tech companies had “controls for public cloud that are as good or better than capabilities we would provide.” He was speaking before the outage, but later said the bank had factored in occasional glitches and remained committed to the cloud. Capital One builds all new applications on the cloud and plans to reduce its data centers from eight to three by next year. John Madsen, co-head of technology at Goldman Sachs, said his bank has worked with vendors to ensure cloud networks were secure and reliable, and was satisfied with the results. “We’ve had a lot of success with those efforts,” he said. Customers, regulators and lawyers acknowledge that cloud failures could, in theory, wreak havoc. That is why large financial institutions have mostly kept highly sensitive data off the cloud and have back-up plans, like using multiple vendors. An apocalyptic scenario where many data centers fail at the same time is highly unlikely, they say. At a conference this month, Scott Mullins, the Amazon executive responsible for generating new cloud business from financial firms, said security has given way to other issues as financial customers’ top concern when making the decision to move. “About four years ago when we began in earnest talking to financial institutions...security was the No. 1 topic,” he said. “Today we don’t spend as much time talking about security.” Reporting by Anna Irrera; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tomasz JanowskiOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Within the next week, users worldwide will be able to share where they are in real time on devices running both Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc’s iOS software, Google said. The feature is part of an array of new tools aimed at boosting the effectiveness of Google Maps, which analysts say is critical to the company’s ambitions in commerce and transport. The location-sharing feature is aimed at helping people find each other in crowded places, such as concerts and conferences, and users will retain control over who they share their whereabouts with and for how long, said Google executive Jen Fitzpatrick, who leads Google Maps. “That coordination in that sort of last-mile moment winds up being sometimes more complicated than you might think,” she told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday. Location-sharing features have sparked alarm among privacy advocates in the past. To address those concerns, Google will remind users both in the app and via email of whom they are sharing their location with. While the recipient of a user’s location could pass that link onto a third party, Google will advise people to use the feature only with those they trust, said Ben Greenwood, a product manager for Google Maps. “This is not a new concept,” Fitzpatrick said of location-sharing. “This is about making it simple, accessible and giving users a lot of control and privacy.” In the coming weeks, Google will also roll out mapping features aimed at helping users find parking and remember where they parked their cars, Fitzpatrick said. Ride-hailing services have also become an important aspect of the app, and Google Maps will have partnerships with 14 companies in 70 countries by the end of the week, she said. Mapping has become a key contributor to Google’s advertising juggernaut, said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research, and the tech giant cannot afford to let the app languish. “It’s an absolutely essential service for them to drive more growth in all of their key revenue-generating businesses,” he said.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"(Repeats story published Thursday to widen distribution) By Julia Love, Jessica Toonkel and Tim Baysinger March 24 (Reuters) - The decision by a handful of high-profile consumer brands to pull advertising from Google’s YouTube over offensive content could threaten the site’s long-term strategy of stealing ad dollars from television, analysts and ad industry professionals said Thursday. The immediate financial impact of the controversy is likely to be limited, in part because a big chunk of YouTube revenue comes from smaller advertisers who lack the budget for TV campaigns and do not have easy alternatives. Some analysts also believe that departing advertisers, eager to reach YouTube’s millennial audience, will quickly return. But with “brand safety” emerging as a major concern for marketers amid a surge in hate speech and other types of offensive content across the internet, the widespread assumption that major advertisers are ready to shift large chunks of their budgets from TV to digital now looks much more dubious. The timing may also favor television networks as they usually present their fall line-ups and woo big advertisers starting in May, agency executives said. YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc, has spent years courting big brands that spend hundreds of millions annually on air time. But over the past week, companies including Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and Johnson & Johnson have canceled their YouTube ad deals. “Video is actually a lot more fragile of an ecosystem than the Silicon Valley, software-eats-everything crowd may want to think,” said Joel Espelien, a senior analyst at the Diffusion Group, which studies the future of television. “The point is all content isn’t actually the same, all advertising isn’t actually all the same. There is an element of taste. And when you ruin that, the whole thing does kind of start to fall apart.” Google offers little visibility into YouTube’s financial performance, but analysts view it as a key driver for the company’s growth as its traditional search advertising business matures. Analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets estimates YouTube will bring in about $14 billion in revenue this year. Alphabet shares have fallen more than 3 percent since Monday, closing at $839.65 on Thursday. Whether the recent events are a mere blip on the radar for Google or a harbinger of bigger problems to come may depend on whether the company can quickly improve its technical tools to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. YouTube has begun reviewing its advertising policies and will take steps to give advertisers more control, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. Google also plans to hire more people for its review team and refine its artificial intelligence – a key step, since much of the ad-serving is handled by automation. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, acknowledged in a Fox News interview that ads appearing next to videos promoting hate speech or advocating violence had slipped through the digital cracks in Google’s elaborate ad-serving systems. “We match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match,” Schmidt said. “We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be OK.” But Google’s public statements have done little to assuage advertisers’ fears, said David Cohen, president, North America, for media buying firm Magna Global. Privately, Google has gone into more detail about how it plans to combat the issue, including ratcheting up its algorithms to better categorize content and being more stringent about how content is labeled, Cohen said. But such additional controls would reduce the percentage of content that carries advertising and could disrupt the vibrant community of independent creators on YouTube, who drive traffic to the site and rely on revenue-sharing from advertising. YouTube faces a special imperative to keep creators happy as rivals such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc try to court talent for their own platforms, said Hank Green, a prominent YouTube creator who runs the VidCon conference. “YouTube has a decade-long head start, but obviously everyone wants a piece of the pie,” he said. Even before the most recent revelations about YouTube, control over online ad placement had become a hot button topic for advertisers. Social networks and news aggregators came under fire during and after the U.S. presidential election for spreading fake news reports, and advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. “Between non-human traffic and fraud, fake news and hate speech, brands are more concerned than ever,” said Marc Goldberg, CEO of Trust Metrics, a New York-based company that addresses ad fraud.

Some analysts also believe that departing advertisers, eager to reach YouTube’s millennial audience, will quickly return. But with “brand safety” emerging as a major concern for marketers amid a surge in hate speech and other types of offensive content across the internet, the widespread assumption that major advertisers are ready to shift large chunks of their budgets from TV to digital now looks much more dubious.

YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), has spent years courting big brands that spend hundreds of millions annually on air time. But over the past week, companies including Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), AT&T Inc (T.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) have canceled their YouTube ad deals. “Video is actually a lot more fragile of an ecosystem than the Silicon Valley, software-eats-everything crowd may want to think,” said Joel Espelien, a senior analyst at the Diffusion Group, which studies the future of television. “The point is all content isn’t actually the same, all advertising isn’t actually all the same. There is an element of taste. And when you ruin that, the whole thing does kind of start to fall apart.” Google offers little visibility into YouTube’s financial performance, but analysts view it as a key driver for the company’s growth as its traditional search advertising business matures.

Facebook Inc added a feature to its Messenger app on Monday to allow users to share their locations continuously for up to an hour, ramping up competition with tools offered by Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google Maps."	"MENLO PARK, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc added a feature to its Messenger app on Monday to allow users to share their locations continuously for up to an hour, ramping up competition with tools offered by Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google Maps. The company has found that one of the most used phrases on Messenger as people talk to friends and family is “How far away are you?” or some variation, Stan Chudnovsky, head of product for Messenger, said in an interview. “It happens to be what people are saying, what they’re interested in the most,” he said. Sharing location information is optional, but it can also be live, so that once a user shares the information with a friend, the friend can watch the user’s movement for up to 60 minutes. Messenger was once part of the core Facebook smartphone app, but the company broke it out as a separate app in 2014 and has since invested in frequent changes to build a service distinct from the massive social network. Google Maps said last week that it was adding a similar live feature, an attempt to boost engagement on a product of increasing strategic importance to that company. The close proximity of the announcements tells Facebook “that we’re working on the right things,” Chudnovsky said. The Messages app on Apple’s iPhone has such a feature, too. Facebook has been testing its change in Mexico, he said. It was ready as long ago as October, he added, but the company worked on it for five more months to minimize the impact on the battery life of phones. Facebook sees the feature being used for convenience to coordinate with friends, for safety-related purposes or for other uses, Chudnovsky said. “There are all sorts of products that you can imagine you could build on top of that,” he said.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Uber executive at the center of a high-profile legal dispute with Alphabet Inc’s Waymo self-driving-car unit has “no basis to believe” any criminal investigation is underway over allegations of trade secret theft, the executive’s lawyer said in a court filing.

Waymo said Uber benefited from those documents. Levandowski is not a defendant in the case, but he is a central figure in the litigation that pits two Silicon Valley technology giants against each other, both of which are vying to dominate in the competitive autonomous vehicles sector.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoThe litigation pits two Silicon Valley giants against each other over technology at the heart of a potential revolution in the auto industry. U.S. District Judge William Alsup said evidence amassed by Waymo to bolster its case of being robbed was extraordinary. “I’ve never seen a record this strong in 42 years,” Alsup said. A hearing on Waymo’s request for an injunction on Uber’s self-driving program is scheduled for May. Waymo sued ride services company Uber earlier this year, claiming that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski downloaded over 14,000 confidential documents before leaving the company to join Uber. Waymo said Uber benefited from those documents and has sued for damages and to stop Uber from using the technology Levandowski allegedly stole. Levandowski is one of the most experienced self-driving car engineers in Silicon Valley, and the loss of his expertise would be a major blow to Uber, which has said autonomous vehicles are crucial to future growth. In court on Wednesday, Uber lawyer Arturo Gonzalez said the company had been working hard to find evidence that Waymo’s documents were in Uber’s possession, but could not find anything material. Waymo waited several months after learning of the downloads before filing a lawsuit over them, Gonzalez said. He argued the time lag before requesting the documents showed the materials are not crucial enough to merit an injunction in the case. Waymo’s attorneys argued that Uber has not searched hard enough. Alsup ordered Uber to conduct a broader search, and said that the weight of Waymo’s evidence “could lead to a preliminary injunction that Levandowski cannot work on this project any more until this case is over.” Alsup emphasized that he had not yet decided how he would rule.

"April 6 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s YouTube said on Thursday it would place ads on videos only if they reach 10,000 views as it tries to weed out channels that make money by stealing content from other sources. The video streaming service also said once a video channel crosses the threshold, it would review the content to see if it qualifies for the placement of ads. bit.ly/2o7vqI2 “By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators,” Ariel Bardin, YouTube’s vice president of product management, said in a blog post. YouTube also said it would add a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program in a few weeks. The YouTube Partner Program lets creators monetize content on YouTube in many ways, including advertisements, paid subscriptions and merchandise. Any revenue earned on channels with under 10,000 views up until Thursday will not be impacted, YouTube said. Google has come under intense scrutiny for ads appearing alongside videos on YouTube carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages recently, forcing a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video streaming service. The company vowed an overhaul of its practices last month, saying it has started an extensive review of its advertising policies.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup said evidence amassed by Waymo to bolster its case of being robbed was extraordinary. “I’ve never seen a record this strong in 42 years,” Alsup said. A hearing on Waymo’s request for an injunction on Uber’s self-driving program is scheduled for May. Waymo sued ride services company Uber earlier this year, claiming that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski downloaded over 14,000 confidential documents before leaving the company to join Uber. Waymo said Uber benefited from those documents and has sued for damages and to stop Uber from using the technology Levandowski allegedly stole. Levandowski is one of the most experienced self-driving car engineers in Silicon Valley, and the loss of his expertise would be a major blow to Uber, which has said autonomous vehicles are crucial to future growth. In court on Wednesday, Uber lawyer Arturo Gonzalez said the company had been working hard to find evidence that Waymo’s documents were in Uber’s possession, but could not find anything material. Waymo waited several months after learning of the downloads before filing a lawsuit over them, Gonzalez said. He argued the time lag before requesting the documents showed the materials are not crucial enough to merit an injunction in the case. Waymo’s attorneys argued that Uber has not searched hard enough. Alsup ordered Uber to conduct a broader search, and said that the weight of Waymo’s evidence “could lead to a preliminary injunction that Levandowski cannot work on this project any more until this case is over.” Alsup emphasized that he had not yet decided how he would rule.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s YouTube said on Thursday it would place ads on channels only if they reach 10,000 views as it tries to weed out people who make money on the site by stealing content from other sources. The video streaming service also said once a video channel crosses the threshold, it would review the content to see if it qualifies for the placement of ads. (bit.ly/2o7vqI2) “By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators,” Ariel Bardin, YouTube’s vice president of product management, said in a blog post. YouTube has come under intense scrutiny for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video streaming service. The company vowed an overhaul of its practices last month, saying it has started an extensive review of its advertising policies. While brands have demanded greater control over the videos where their ads appear, the step taken by YouTube this week is likely too small to allay those concerns, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “Most of these (extremist) videos are going to get more viewers than that anyway,” Dawson said of the 10,000-view threshold set by YouTube. “They’re popular among the particular audience that they are targeting.” YouTube also said on Thursday that in a few weeks it would add a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program, which lets creators monetize content on YouTube in many ways, including advertisements, paid subscriptions and merchandise. Any revenue earned on channels with under 10,000 views up until Thursday will not be impacted, YouTube said. As it grapples with the advertiser revolt, YouTube must walk a fine line between giving advertisers more control and alienating the creators who drive the site’s popularity, analysts say. While some fear small creators could be hurt by restrictions, the 10,000-view threshold is so low that it will not hamper any people who make a living from their channels, said Jonathan Katz, an entertainment lawyer who represents YouTube artists. Creators understand that YouTube must protect its image to retain the ad dollars they depend on, he said. “As frustrated as (creators) might be with the YouTube ecosystem at times, they understand that their fates are tied,” he said.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"(Repeats story published overnight) By Ross Kerber BOSTON, April 10 (Reuters) - Shareholder activism is rare in Islamic finance, but one wealth manager has staked out new territory as the most outspoken voice among Muslim investors in the United States. Working from an office in Falls Church, Virginia, Bashar Qasem was the only Islamic financial representative among religious shareholder advocates who sent a letter in February to protest U.S. President Donald Trump’s travel ban. It was only one of a number of such moves since 2015, when Qasem’s Azzad Asset Management firm started weighing in on issues like worker safety, climate change and lobbying disclosures. This direct advocacy will test whether many U.S. Muslim investors will support the sort of faith-based shareholder activism common among other religious groups even as many cite safety concerns or have experienced bullying. Qasem said his clients seemed to welcome his growing public role. Most are Muslim, and about half are immigrants. “Most of them, they feel it’s about time,” said Qasem, who grew up in Jordan, moved to the United States in 1987 and became a citizen in 1996. So far Qasem’s strategy appears to be helping to differentiate his firm at a time when the popularity of cheaper index-tracking products is rising. Azzad’s assets increased 11 percent in 2016 to $487 million at year-end. Growth included $5.7 million into the firm’s mutual funds, the third consecutive year of inflows. By contrast, the Amana family of mutual funds, which Morningstar says is the largest in U.S. Islamic finance at $2.9 billion of assets, has had three years of investor withdrawals, which it blames partly on the rise of passively managed products. Laila El-Haddad, who writes about food and Palestinian politics, said Qasem’s outspokenness helped draw her to his firm. “Given the choices between two Islamic investment companies,” she said, “we would definitely opt for the one taking this approach.” TESTING INVESTORS’ FAITH Funds involved in Islamic finance are sometimes classified as “Sharia-compliant,” or adhering to religious precepts such as avoiding investments in alcoholic beverage companies and businesses making or receiving interest payments. Qasem said he preferred the term “Halal investing,” referring to the Arabic word for “permitted” investments. Islamic finance assets stood at $2 trillion worldwide in 2015, up from $1.7 trillion in 2012, according to the latest Thomson Reuters data. The much smaller $4.6 billion U.S. Islamic finance sector, however, has grown little in recent years. Only a few institutions, mostly community banks, have significant Islamic lending practices. Ibrahim Warde, an adjunct professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the slow growth reflected both U.S. regulations that make some Islamic products difficult to offer and some Muslim financial executives’ desire to avoid drawing attention, given the public mood. “There’s this question of keeping a low profile,” he said. Sheraz Iftikhar, managing partner of New York wealth manager Arch Global Advisors, said his clients, who are mainly Muslim, had not changed their investment strategies lately. “It’s too early to see a change in Muslim investor sentiment,” said Iftikhar. Typical of Qasem’s recent efforts is a measure that Azzad co-filed in January, calling on Google parent Alphabet Inc to adopt “Holy Land Principles” that would lead U.S. companies doing business is Israel to hire more Palestinian Arabs. Azzad spokesman Joshua Brockwell said Alphabet told the firm it would hold a vote on the measure at its annual meeting. Azzad has also co-filed a shareholder resolution calling on Exxon Mobil Corp to disclose more about its spending on lobbying. Brockwell said the oil company would probably oppose the measure, as it did last year. Spokesmen for Alphabet and Exxon declined to comment. In addition, Qasem signed on to a Feb. 1 letter from the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility and other groups, urging business leaders to use an upcoming meeting with Trump to speak out against his ban on travelers from a number of Muslim-majority nations. Courts have since blocked the restrictions, and the U.S. Justice Department has appealed the rulings. While the ban jarred Qasem and some of his clients, he expressed optimism about U.S. economic growth prospects, given Trump’s agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure investments. Higher interest rates could also help Azzad’s holdings in low-debt companies, he said. “After all,” Qasem said of Trump, “he’s a businessman.” (Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"(Repeats for wider distribution) By Edward Taylor and Paul Lienert FRANKFURT/DETROIT, April 13 (Reuters) - The race to develop and exploit autonomous vehicle technology is reshaping the hierarchy of the automotive industry, replacing traditional top-down manufacturing relationships with complex webs of alliances and acquisitions. Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world’s biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG’s Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV , and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-2021. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. “Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc’s Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. COPILOT APPROACH Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc, competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd (For a graphic on self-driving vehicles see: tmsnrt.rs/2nYv7gc) The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house - as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology. “At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together,” said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo. BCG’s Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology. “These different approaches will have to pass the test of time,” he said. “In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach.” Reporting by Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Matthew LewisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Help Wanted: A chief operating officer to help change a Silicon Valley giant’s now-notorious “bro” culture, but who can thrive in a power dynamic that hands the boss overwhelming control. At Uber Technologies Inc. [UBER.UL], co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick commands everything from board decision-making to the exact hour the beer taps will open at the company’s San Francisco headquarters. That management approach is rooted in more than just a cult of personality. Uber’s governance and share structure, and the “founder-friendly” terms of the $13 billion in equity the company has raised, give Kalanick, his co-founder and a fellow employee ultimate control over the company, according to company documents and an Uber investor with knowledge of the matter. As the company searches for a chief operating officer who can in theory take on some of Kalanick’s sweeping authority, that looks to be a problem. “A COO would report into Travis, so structurally, there’s the rub,” said Dave Carvajal, an executive recruiter for venture-backed tech companies. “This COO is going to need to have influence at the board level to effect change.” Kalanick’s near-total control at Uber is made possible largely by a dual-class share structure that gives certain owners 10 votes per share, according the company’s certificate of incorporation filed with the State of Delaware. Kalanick, along with Garrett Camp, Uber’s co-founder who is now working on another startup, and Ryan Graves, Uber CEO prior to Kalanick, together hold enough of those super-voting shares to give them control of the company, according to an Uber investor with knowledge of the matter. The documents say Uber’s executive board may have eleven voting members, including nine seats controlled by shareholders with super-voting rights. But Kalanick has kept the power circle small, leaving four board seats empty. In addition to Kalanick, Camp and Graves, the board includes venture capitalist Bill Gurley of Benchmark, David Bonderman of TPG Capital, Yasir Al Rumayyan of the Saudi Arabian public investment fund and media impresario Arianna Huffington. Leaving control with founders has become popular in Silicon Valley in recent years, both because of the success of founder-led enterprises like Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and because investors compete with each other to fund entrepreneurs by offering them the best terms. Those circumstances helped Uber obtain a $68 billion valuation, the biggest of any private venture-backed company. But with Uber rocked by scandals, including detailed accusations of sexual harassment from a former female employee and a video showing Kalanick harshly berating an Uber driver, Kalanick just weeks ago promised to “grow up” and hire a COO who would offer “leadership help.” The COO search is ongoing, but Uber’s human resources chief told reporters last month that Kalanick, 40, is already showing a more collaborative style. The share structure leaves investors with few options if they lose patience with Kalanick, though there is little sign of that happening. With two public exceptions, investors have either supported Kalanick or stayed silent as the company’s all-important rider numbers continue to grow even in the face of controversy. Mitchell Green, a partner at Lead Edge Capital that invested in Uber at a $40 billion valuation, believes the controversies will blow over and he even wants to buy more stock. “We believe that Travis continues to drive shareholder equity value higher,” said Green. CONTROL A COO DETERRENT? The most effective COOs have broad authority and direct access to the board, governance experts say. At Facebook, for example, COO Sheryl Sandberg works in partnership with founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and holds a board seat. At Uber, it’s not so easy to envision what a power-sharing arrangement would look like, or how the brash founder could be an agent of managerial change under such a governance structure, the experts said. “People don’t like to correct their own homework,” said Bill Aulet, managing director of the entrepreneurship center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This is a situation where the checks and balances are not really in place.” An Uber spokesman declined to comment for this story. A string of high-level executive departures – including company president Jeff Jones last month and top communications chief Rachel Whetstone this week – has centralized even more authority with Kalanick and raised questions about the staying power of his deputies. Kalanick is known to obsess over details like office decor alongside big issues like pricing strategy and driver relations. Kalanick at one point ordered the beer taps in the office locked during certain hours, controlling when employees could pour themselves a pint, after expressing displeasure with one imbibing staff member, said one former employee. The CEO closely managed Uber’s logo redesign last year, despite himself not being a designer, according to a source close to the company. Design chief Andrew Crow announced he was quitting the day after the new logo was unveiled. FILE PHOTO - Uber CEO Travis Kalanick speaks to students during an interaction at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus in Mumbai, India, January 19, 2016. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File photoSoon after, Kalanick rejected the new logo designers brought him for Uber Eats, the company’s food-delivery business, upset that the team hadn’t shown him every iteration of the design, according to a second former employee. The CEO also at times edited press statements following a PR incident, the former employee said. He was especially anxious that the company didn’t come across as too apologetic. This sort of iron grip may deter qualified COO candidates who “don’t want to do their job with one arm tied behind their back,” said Robert Siegel, a lecturer at Stanford University and venture capitalist at XSeed Capital.

That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG’s (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies.

Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programing and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co (GM.N) are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house.

"(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this photo illustration taken in Berlin, August 11, 2015. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo Alphabet’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc (FB.O), Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. “It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. “Our great properties — like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play — are the ‘prime time’ for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that “YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate,” dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google’s non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. “We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business,” Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors’ concerns about Google’s dependence on search, Wang said. “We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company,” he said. “That is quite an impressive achievement.” On the other hand, Alphabet’s “Other Bets”—separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily—continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down.” Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru and Julia Love in San Francisco.

Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that “YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate,” dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google’s non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. “We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business,” Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors’ concerns about Google’s dependence on search, Wang said. “We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company,” he said. “That is quite an impressive achievement.” On the other hand, Alphabet’s “Other Bets”—separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily—continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down.” Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru and Julia Love in San Francisco.

"04-27-2017"	"US STOCKS-Earnings lift Nasdaq to record; Amazon, Alphabet up after hours "	"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks/us-stocks-earnings-lift-nasdaq-to-record-amazon-alphabet-up-after-hours-idUSL1N1HZ2FR"	"* Dow up 0.03 pct, S&P 500 up 0.06 pct, Nasdaq up 0.39 pct (Updates with after hours moves in Amazon, Alphabet, others)"	"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite ended at a record high on Thursday, boosted by results-related gains in Comcast, PayPal and Intuit, while the S&P 500 and the Dow were little changed. The tech-heavy index is likely to extend its record-breaking string of gains as heavyweights Amazon and Alphabet jumped more than 4 percent each after the bell, following stellar earnings. Earnings were back in the spotlight, a day after the Trump administration unveiled its tax reform priorities without details on how the reform would be paid for, raising questions on whether deficit hawks in Congress would support it. Comcast (CMCSA.O) rose 2.1 percent to $39.59 after touching a record high of $40.62 as strong subscriber growth brought a forecast-beating profit. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 12.4 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Most folks were expecting a build in earnings acceleration and that’s what we’ve got. Despite all the economic and geopolitical noise, ultimately the market has been responding to improving earnings,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. He said a premium has been built into stock prices on bets of tax reform and other policies expected from the Trump administration, so “when that is in question you see a sideways action.” U.S. businesses would mostly benefit if President Donald Trump’s plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas becomes law. But the economic benefits and the timing of a possible bill remain in question.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 6.24 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,981.33, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.32 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,388.77 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 23.71 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,048.94. In after-hours trading, Amazon (AMZN.O) added 4.1 percent to $955.92 while Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) jumped 4.5 percent to $931.91 as both continue to race to $1,000. Alphabet jumped as Google’s ad revenue rose 18.8 percent to $21.41 billion in the first quarter, while Amazon reported revenue and profit that topped analysts’ estimates. In regular market hours, Intuit (INTU.O) rose 8.5 percent to $125.61 after it reported consumer tax-season results and reiterated its quarter and full-year forecast. PayPal (PYPL.O) shares hit a record high a day after it raised its earnings outlook and reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Sportswear maker Under Armour (UAA.N) shares jumped 9.9 percent to $21.67 after it posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Energy .SPNY was the biggest decliner among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, falling 1.1 percent on the back of a 0.8 percent decline in U.S. crude futures CLc1. American Airlines (AAL.O) dropped 5.2 percent to $43.98. The company said it had offered a mid-contract pay increase for pilots and flight attendants that JPMorgan analysts called “a wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups.” Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidIndexes ticked up but declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1.03-to-1 while on Nasdaq a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 76 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 180 new highs and 45 new lows. About 7.18 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

"(Reuters) - Shares of Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) surged as much as 24 percent in their stock market debut on Friday, the latest in a string of technology initial public offerings this year, giving the big-data analytics company a market value of about $2.3 billion. Cloudera’s offering of 15 million shares was priced at $15 per share, above its expected range of $12-$14, and raised $225 million. Shares opened at $17.80 on the New York Stock Exchange and hit a high of $18.64 in early trading. Cloudera helps businesses store, process and analyze data through Hadoop, an open-source software system that can sort and handle massive amounts of information. The company has more than 1,000 customers, including Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), Citigroup (C.N), MasterCard (MA.N) and Cisco Systems (CSCO.O). Its closest rival, Hortonworks Inc HDP.O, whose offerings are also tied to Hadoop, went public in February last year. Hortonworks’ shares had climbed about 11 percent since then. Palo Alto, California-based Cloudera’s valuation is a steep fall from the $4.1 billion it was once valued at in the private market. Investors including chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) piled into Cloudera several years ago when a flood of money into private technology companies pushed valuations skyward. This year has been a hotbed for technology IPOs after a dull 2016, which marked the slowest year for such IPOs since 2008, when just 20 technology companies went public. The number of U.S. IPOs has more than tripled so far in 2017, compared to year-ago levels, with the technology sector leading the issuance market, according to Thomson Reuters data. Snap Inc (SNAP.N), the owner of the popular image-sharing app Snapchat, grabbed eyeballs when it went public last month in the biggest technology IPO in three years. Cloudera, founded in 2008, is backed by Fidelity Investments as well as high-profile investors including T. Rowe Price and Google Ventures, the venture capital investment arm of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). Intel will hold a 19.4 percent stake in the company after its IPO. Cloudera’s revenue for the year ended Jan. 31 was $261 million, increasing 57 percent from a year ago. It reported a net loss of $185.3 million and is yet to post a profit. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Allen & Co LLC were among the top underwriters to the IPO, which was widely anticipated by investors for over a year.

"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store, has long been sandwiched between Google’s advertising juggernaut and its moonshot ventures that have captured popular imagination. FILE PHOTO: A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this photo illustration taken in Berlin on August 11, 2015. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File PhotoNot any more. The business, categorized as “Other Revenue” in its earnings report, posted a 49.4 percent jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday – a sum already bigger than Twitter Inc’s annual revenue. The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet’s total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google’s efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. “(Google) is doing a good job, a much better job in diversifying revenue than Facebook is,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. “We think that is quite an impressive achievement.” Alphabet does not break out revenue contribution within the “Other Revenue” segment. But analysts have said that cloud is the most prominent among the category’s clutch of businesses. To be sure, Google’s cloud venture is still much smaller than market leader Amazon.com Inc’s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp’s Azure. But Google is investing heavily. “In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud,” Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon’s cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft’s cloud unit grew 93 percent. “We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google’s hardware products, we see Google’s ‘other’ revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017,” Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note. The company’s hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year - the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon’s Echo. “People are hankering for a really awesome Android phone that basically gives them the iPhone experience,” Wang said, adding that the growth in Google’s “other revenue” bucket this quarter “shows sustained momentum for the Pixel.” Still, the lion’s share of Alphabet’s revenue comes from ads and that’s not going to change any time soon. Total advertising revenue increased 18.8 percent to $21.1 billion in the first quarter, the company reported on Thursday. Profit also rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, beating Wall Street estimates. At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after the earnings report. Alphabet’s drive for diversification also includes its “Other Bets” business, considered the company’s loss-making arm. The business, home to the Waymo self-driving car, Google Fiber and thermostat-maker Nest, posted a first-quarter loss of $855 million. Google’s shares were up 4.6 percent at a record high of $932.73 on Friday morning. They have gained 12.5 percent this year up to Thursday’s close.

GLOBAL TOP NEWS  • Trump says "major, major" conflict with N.Korea possible, but seeks diplomacy  U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday a major conflict with North Korea is possible in the standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, but he would prefer a diplomatic outcome to the dispute.  • Japan's March core inflation, manufacturing miss forecasts, keep pressure on BOJ  Japan's core consumer prices rose at a slower than expected pace in March and household spending fell more than expected in a worrying sign for the central bank that domestic demand won't be strong enough to generate sustained inflation.  • Google parent Alphabet's profit up 29 percent on strong ad sales  Google parent Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact.       LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK  (As reported by NewsRise)  • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 9,362.00, trading little changed from its previous close.  • The Indian rupee is likely to edge higher against the dollar in early trade amid bets that local shares will track overnight gains in Wall Street, spurring foreign fund inflows.  • Indian government bonds may trade largely unchanged ahead of a weekly supply of notes today, even as lower U.S. yields may trigger some buying. The yield on the benchmark 6.97 pct bond maturing in 2026 is likely to trade in a 6.92 pct - 6.97 pct band today.      GLOBAL MARKETS  • The Nasdaq Composite ended at a record high on Thursday, boosted by results-related gains in Comcast, PayPal and Intuit, while the S&P 500 and the Dow were little changed.  • Asian stocks inched higher and looked set to close a strong week on a positive note, while the euro slipped after the European Central Bank showed no signs of paring its stimulus programme.  • The dollar edged up in Asian trading but was on track for a losing month against a basket of currencies, while the euro shed some of its monthly gains after the European Central Bank maintained its easing bias.  • U.S. Treasury prices rose on Thursday, as investors sought the safety of bonds in the face of doubts about President Donald Trump's unimpressive tax plan and persistent geopolitical tensions in North Korea and Syria.  • Oil prices rose but were still on track for a second straight weekly loss on concerns that an OPEC-led production cut has failed to significantly tighten an oversupplied market.  • Gold was little changed but poised for the biggest weekly fall in seven weeks as investors sought out riskier assets, dampening demand for gold, which pays no interest.

"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) warned its users to beware of emails from known contacts asking them to click on a link to Google Docs after a large number of people turned to social media to complain that their accounts had been hacked. A security guard keeps watch as he walks past a logo of Google in Shanghai, China, April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Aly Song/File PhotoGoogle said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. The attack used a relatively novel approach to phishing, a hacking technique designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information, by gaining access to user accounts without needing to obtain their passwords. They did that by getting an already logged-in user to grant access to a malicious application posing as Google Docs. “This is the future of phishing,” said Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at PhishMe Inc. “It gets attackers to their goal ... without having to go through the pain of putting malware on a device.” He said the hackers had also pointed some users to another site, since taken down, that sought to capture their passwords. Google said its abuse team “is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” Anybody who granted access to the malicious app unknowingly also gave hackers access to their Google account data including emails, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. “This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,” said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday afternoon, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data.

"DETROIT (Reuters) - Automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH.N) on Wednesday said it plans to spin off operations tied to internal combustion engines and focus on technology for electrically powered and self-driving vehicles, boosting its share price and highlighting the challenges for legacy auto industry players. FILE PHOTO: An autonomous car from Delphi departs Treasure Island for a cross-country trip from San Francisco to New York City in San Francisco, California, U.S. on March 22, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File PhotoVehicles driven by humans and powered with petroleum will dominate roads from Shanghai to San Francisco for years to come, but investors who supply the capital to produce such vehicles are signaling a belief that after a century-long run, internal combustion cars are a sunset industry. The most dramatic symbol of this turn is electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) ascent this year to a higher market capitalization than either Ford Motor Co (F.N) or General Motors Co (GM.N). Despite a recent slump in U.S. sales, the Detroit giants are robustly profitable, while Tesla has yet to earn a full year profit. Tesla reports first-quarter results later Wednesday. Delphi shares rose as much as 12 percent on Wednesday after the company announced its plan to separate into two entities - one dedicated to internal combustion technology and the other focused on electrification and automation. The shares closed at $87.01, up nearly 11 percent, representing about $2 billion in added market value. “There’s a whole element of the componentry of the car that Wall Street values at a lower level,” Delphi Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. Other big auto suppliers are making similar calls. German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] earlier this week said it had sold its starters and alternators business to a Chinese mining company. Germany’s Rheinmetall (RHMG.DE) also tried to float its Kolbenschmidt Pierburg unit, which is specialized in the development, manufacture and aftermarket supply of pistons, engine blocks, and plain bearings back in 2012. However, it was forced to call off the IPO due to a market slump and a lack of investor enthusiasm for a stock with heavy exposure to combustion engine technology, bankers said. Combustion engines are taking a hit from regulators, particularly those in Europe and China, who want to slash greenhouse gas and smog forming emissions on a fast timetable. That risk was exacerbated by Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) diesel emissions scandal. As a result of “Dieselgate,” politicians in cities like Stuttgart have discussed banning diesel vehicles from the inner city, leading customers to abandon diesel cars. On Wednesday, German car registration figures provided by Germany’s KBA federal motor authority, showed that demand for diesel engine vehicles plunged by 19.3 percent in April, to a market share of 41.3 percent of overall registrations. Delphi’s Clark said he expects diesel production to decline by about 3 percent a year for the next few years. China’s government has also set aggressive targets for electric vehicles that are forcing carmakers to accelerate electric vehicle plans. POWERTRAIN OPERATIONS HAS ROOM TO GROW U.S. auto supplier Visteon VC.N, like Delphi, has shed most of its traditional car parts making operations, and is focused on connected vehicle technology and infotainment. Clark said Delphi’s powertrain business, which has about $4.5 billion in annual revenues and does not yet have a name, has room to grow. The company will have more freedom to invest in that growth as its managers no longer have to compete for capital with opportunities presented by the increasing computerization of cars, Clark said. The powertrain company, which accounted for about 27 percent of Delphi revenues last year, also could seize opportunities to consolidate other players in the legacy market, capitalizing on the continued demand for internal combustion and the regulatory pressure to make them cleaner, a person familiar with Delphi’s strategy said. Analysts on Wednesday estimated Delphi’s powertrain business will be valued at six to seven times earnings before interest and taxes, while the electronic and autonomous technology side of the company will likely command a higher valuation. The electronic Delphi - which also could get a new name - will compete in a potential market the company estimates at more than $100 billion a year, nearly twice the size of the internal combustion market. Delphi said its electronic systems units had about $12 billion in revenue last year. Delphi “is best positioned to be the ‘picks and shovels’ supplier of big data solutions” to automakers, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note on Wednesday. But the market of the future is still largely in the future. Most established car makers, for instance, have not adopted over the air software upgrades on a mass scale, and depend entirely on internal combustion engine cars and sport utilities for profits. Clark said over the next three to five years demand will accelerate for high speed in-vehicle data networking systems, autonomous driving technology and over the air software updates. Delphi has acquired a company that enables over the air software updates, as well as a company that develops high speed data networks. Clark said Delphi could make more acquisitions to expand its electronic systems capability, or forge more partnerships. Delphi has partnerships through its autonomous vehicle business with Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N, which is being bought by Intel for $15.3 billion. “If we can do more things like that” the Mobileye-Intel partnership, “that would be great,” Clark said. Delphi is betting that many automakers will ultimately opt to buy a standard system rather than invest in one-of-a-kind systems of their own. Delphi said it expects to launch its turnkey autonomous driving system with a customer in 2019. The spinoff will be tax free and is expected to be completed by March 2018, Delphi said.

"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) warned its users to beware of emails from known contacts asking them to click on a link to Google Docs after a large number of people turned to social media to complain that their accounts had been hacked. A security guard keeps watch as he walks past a logo of Google in Shanghai, China, April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Aly Song/File PhotoGoogle said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. The attack used a relatively novel approach to phishing, a hacking technique designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information, by gaining access to user accounts without needing to obtain their passwords. They did that by getting an already logged-in user to grant access to a malicious application posing as Google Docs. “This is the future of phishing,” said Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at PhishMe Inc. “It gets attackers to their goal ... without having to go through the pain of putting malware on a device.” He said the hackers had also pointed some users to another site, since taken down, that sought to capture their passwords. Google said its abuse team “is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” Anybody who granted access to the malicious app unknowingly also gave hackers access to their Google account data including emails, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. “This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,” said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday afternoon, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data.

"(Reuters) - Mobile phone apps took center stage at Google’s annual developer conference on Wednesday as the search giant announced new features for its digital assistant and its popular photo app while devoting little time to the Android mobile operating system. Addressing an audience of thousands of developers in Mountain View, California, Google executives delivered a broad-based update to their product portfolio which also included a slate of new features for the Google Home speaker, a job search tool and even a set of new virtual reality headsets. In a sign of the ongoing strategic importance of Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligence-driven, voice-controlled digital assistant, Google announced it would make the product available on Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone, making a play for the higher end of the smartphone market and challenging Apple’s Siri feature on its own devices. What’s more, the assistant will soon be able to complete transactions and supply information about objects captured by the smartphone’s camera, executives said. But several analysts noted that the emphasis on the assistant and other apps like photos and maps, which run on many types of devices, resulted in the company’s Android operating system — long the cornerstone of Google’s mobile strategy — getting relatively little attention during the presentation. That reflects a recognition by the search giant that the assistant and other apps will be increasingly important to its future, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. The strategy helps the company sidestep some of the complications of developing new features for the vast Android ecosystem, where only a fraction of devices are running on the latest version of the operating system, he noted. “This is partly a concession to the fact that whatever they put into Android, most users don’t see it for a couple years ... and a lot of their best, most attractive, most valuable users are going to be on other platforms,” Dawson said. “They need to put that functionality where users are.” The Google Assistant debuted last year on the company’s own hardware, and Google has gradually extended the tool to devices from other manufacturers running on its Android operating system. Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are competing to establish the dominant voice-powered digital assistant, which many in the industry believe will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way that users interact with technology. “Humans are interacting with computing in more natural and immersive ways,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the audience. “We’ve been using voice as an input across many of our products. We’ve had significant breakthroughs.” The company is also gaining traction with its photo app, which now reaches 500 million users regularly, Pichai said. To drive greater usage of the app, Google will now make suggestions to prod users to share images and allow them to order physical photo albums. Pichai also announced the company will expand its search engine with a new jobs tab that will allow candidates to filter postings by criteria such as wages and commute time. Slideshow (6 Images)Google, which gets most of its revenue from its dominant search engine, also released a host of new features for Google Home, a speaker released last year. Users will soon be able to make phone calls using the device, and the HBO Now streaming service, owned by Time Warner Inc TWX.N, will be integrated as well. While Amazon’s Echo speaker has emerged as the most popular device in the category, Google repeatedly touted its ability to use artificial intelligence to identify multiple users, an edge it has over Amazon. “Google was putting forward a message about artificial intelligence and how they are including the technology in virtually every aspect of their products and services,” said analyst Brian Blau of Gartner. “They really pushed that message hard.” Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Bill Rigby and Phil BerlowitzOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is pictured inside the newly opened Omotesando Apple store at a shopping district in Tokyo June 26, 2014. REUTERS/Yuya Shino/File Photo Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co (F.N) invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]. Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence.

Uber had hoped Levandowski, one the most respected self-driving engineers in Silicon Valley, would help the ride services company catch up to rivals including Waymo, in the race for self-driving technology. Instead the hiring led to a court fight and the threat of criminal charges. Uber replaced him as the head of its self-driving car unit in April before finally making the decision to fire him. Levandowski formerly worked for Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving division, which says he stole trade secrets by downloading more than 14,000 documents before he left. Levandowski is not a defendant, but his actions are at the heart of Alphabet’s lawsuit against Uber. Uber said in a letter to Levandowski filed in federal court on Tuesday that it was firing him because he had not complied with a court order to hand over the documents. (tmsnrt.rs/2rBPNzW) He has declined to cooperate, citing his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. Levandowski’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Uber and Alphabet are battling over technology expected to revolutionize the way people use cars. Waymo claims its trade secrets made their way into Uber’s Lidar technology, which bounces light pulses off objects so self-driving cars can “see” the road. Uber denies these claims. Levandowski has 20 days to comply with the court orders, according to the Uber letter. Last month, Uber named Eric Meyhofer to replace Levandowski as head of its Advanced Technologies Group. Meyhofer will continue to lead the team, an Uber spokeswoman said via email. The New York Times reported Levandowski's exit earlier on Tuesday, citing an internal email sent to employees. (nyti.ms/2qD4X3h) “Over the last few months Uber has provided significant evidence to the court to demonstrate that our self-driving technology has been built independently,” Angela Padilla, Uber’s associate general counsel for employment and litigation, wrote in an email to employees, cited by the Times. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed the letter’s authenticity and said the company has urged Levandowski to “fully cooperate.” Waymo has said Levandowski received stock worth more than $250 million for joining Uber, along with his portion of the $680 million that Uber paid last year for Otto, the self-driving truck company he formed after leaving Google. That amount assumes certain targets would be met, and it was not clear how his firing would affect those payments. A source familiar with the matter said Levandowski had not yet vested his Uber shares. LEVANDOWSKI REFUSAL Levandowski, a top engineer on self-driving technology, has turned into a liability for Uber in court. The company has acknowledged that his refusal to testify has hurt its defense efforts. Uber has never denied that he took the Waymo documents. Asked last month why Uber did not threaten to fire Levandowski to pressure him into turning over the documents, Uber attorney Arturo Gonzalez told Reuters, “We can fire him but we still don’t get the documents.” Uber had argued that it was acceptable to sideline Levandowski by preventing him from working on Lidar technology, but not firing him. But U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup criticized the company, telling lawyers: “You keep on your payroll someone who took 14,000 documents and is liable to use them.” The judge theorized that Levandowski could have used Waymo’s documents himself even if he did not turn them over to Uber. FILE PHOTO: A man exits the Uber offices in Queens, New York, U.S., February 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo “What prevented him from bringing a laptop to work every day and consulting the files?” Alsup asked Uber lawyers in April. Uber has been hit by a string of departures of senior executives and other negative news. Earlier this year, Uber was caught using its technology to avoid government regulators. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick was seen on video berating an Uber driver, and the company also faced accusations of sexual harassment that led to an internal probe led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. The Holder report will be shown to the board this week, a source familiar with the matter said, adding that next week, Uber plans to speak with employees about it.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the U.S. company. FILE PHOTO: A Google logo is seen in a store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 24, 2017. To match Exclusive EU-GOOGLE/ANTITRUST REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoThe European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon (AMZN.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O). Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission’s tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop “scraping” reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its “AdSense for Search” platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

"(Adds comments from Kenya state firms; Vestas hopes to secure new African order soon) By Stine Jacobsen and Colin Leopold COPENHAGEN, June 7 (Reuters) - The biggest wind farm in sub-Saharan Africa is ready for launch but will remain idle until next year as Kenya’s government has not yet installed the transmission lines needed to get the clean power to customers, the provider of the turbines said. Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems installed 365 turbines at Lake Turkana in the hot desert north of the east African country in March, completing construction in less than a year and two months ahead of schedule. The project, which will add 310 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, is located in one of Africa’s windiest places. Costing 70 billion Kenyan shillings ($678 million), it is the country’s largest single private investment and closely watched by investors looking for opportunities in African renewable energy. The wind farm had planned to begin producing power this month, but construction of the transmission line to the power grid, being built by state-run Kenya Transmission Company (KetraCo), has been delayed. “The challenge is now to get the wind farms connected to the grid and that is indeed a project which is not with us,” head of Vestas’ Central European and sub-Saharan business Nils de Baar told Reuters at the Africa Energy Forum in Copenhagen. “The expectation is that it will happen in early 2018,” he said, adding that the project is Vestas’ largest-ever in terms of the number of wind turbines being installed. The 428 km powerline from Loiyangalani in northern Kenya to Suswa in the centre of the country was due to be completed by October last year, but demands for compensation from landowners along the route and other issues have delayed it. KetraCo is targeting completion of the transmission line in August, an official with the company said Wednesday. An official at Kenya Power, owner and operator of the electricity transmission system, also stressed the company intends to honour its agreement and is working to identify a number of issues regarding compensation to the developer. The Lake Turkana consortium consists of KP&P Africa, Aldwych International, Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation, Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Sandpiper and Vestas. Once completed, Google, a part of Alphabet Inc, will acquire Vestas’ 12.5 percent stake in the project. Once in operation, the Turkana Lake wind farm is expected to provide 15 percent of Kenya’s total electricity needs. The east African nation relies heavily on geothermal and hydro power for its electricity supply. The project had originally been due to start generating power in June 2011, but faced delays securing financing and construction did not start until 2014. Despite an abundance of funding, investments in renewable energy in Africa are only developing slowly due to problems with bureaucracy and infrastructure. Still, Vestas said Wednesday it hopes to announce new wind farm projects in Morocco and West Africa “very soon”. Last year, it secured just one order on the continent, a 120 MW project in Morocco, and delivered a 181 MW project in South Africa.

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has reached a tax settlement with Alphabet Inc’s Google for 2016, the country’s finance minister said, following a months-long dispute over allegations that the search giant had not made enough annual payments to the government. FILE PHOTO: A Google logo is seen in a store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 24, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoA senior tax official had said in September that Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, planned to pursue Google for five years of back taxes and the company could face a bill of more than $400 million for 2015 alone if it were found to have avoided payments. “We already have an agreement with them based on 2016. But we can’t disclose the figure,” Indonesia Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told reporters on Tuesday. It was unclear if both sides were still locking horns over Google’s taxes for other years. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Indonesia is eager to ramp up tax collection to narrow its budget deficit and fund an ambitious infrastructure program. Other governments around the world are also seeking to clamp down on what they see as corporate tax avoidance. Last year, Google agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($164 million) in back taxes to settle a probe by Britain’s tax authority, while Thailand is studying plans to toughen tax collection rules for internet and technology firms. According to Indonesian tax officials, most of Google’s revenue generated in the country is booked at its Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore. They also estimated that total advertising revenue for the industry in Indonesia was around $830 million, with Google and Facebook Inc accounting for around 70 percent of that. But Google has pointed to a joint study by the company and Singapore state investor Temasek that estimated the size of Indonesia’s digital advertising market at $300 million for 2015. Senior executives from Google’s Asia Pacific headquarters also met Indonesian tax officials in October to discuss its tax bill, a person with knowledge of the matter said.

"NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. technology sector fell on Thursday, pulled down by heavyweights including Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc after bearish analyst research gave investors a reason to take profits on the stock market’s recent champion sector. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 1.4 percent while The S&P 500 information technology index was down 1.7 percent. Google’s parent Alphabet fell 2.7 percent, making it the second-biggest percentage loser in the S&P technology sector after Canaccord Genuity downgraded its rating of the stock to “hold,” from “buy.” The top percentage losers in the technology index were Advanced Micro Devices, down 4.6 percent, and Lam Research, down 2.97 percent. The downgrade triggered a broader tech selloff, according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Also, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote that Apple is near the peak valuation levels in its iPhone 6 cycle which “could mean a bumpy ride lower” if the prospects for a mega sales cycle diminish for its next smartphone. Apple shares fell 1.9 percent after the report. “I think it’s a perfectly normal backing off. Tech has done really well. All of sudden everyone wakes up and says, ‘Holy cow, maybe we’re getting ahead of ourselves,’ and backs off a little bit,” said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. “I don’t think this is going to be sustained, simply because if you look at the aggregate valuations … tech is not really any more expensive than the market as a whole. Arguably, you are getting a lot more growth at a pretty reasonable price. And that is what has driven the performance so far, but the reality is that is still the case.” The selloff came a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates, as expected, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank could start selling bonds on its balance sheet “very soon”. While the tech sector has fallen more than 4 percent since last Thursday, it is still up around 17 percent year-to-date, double the roughly 8-percent rise for the S&P 500. That makes technology vulnerable to a pullback, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York, who saw no fundamental reason for the move. “Any type of concern in the market, any reason to raise cash levels, very likely these are the first stocks to go to because of the valuation ... because they’ve become so dominant in portfolios,” said Ghriskey who said the selloff is a short-term blip.

Kalanick’s departure caps a tumultuous period for the world’s largest ride-services company that has revolutionized the taxi industry and challenged transportation regulations worldwide. The resignation sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and leaves Uber’s board of directors with the problem of finding a dynamic leader who also has a steady hand needed to heal Uber after a bruising six months. “The person who still best personifies Uber’s potential is the person who left Tuesday night,” said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor and adviser. “But it’s not like he really could stay without it being brutally bad for the company.” Kalanick’s pugnacious style largely defined Uber’s approach and helped it become a transportation colossus valued at $68 billion, the largest private firm backed by venture capitalists in the world. But that brashness has also been blamed for a string of scandals this year, from the unearthing of a culture of sexism and bullying at Uber to a U.S. Department of Justice federal investigation and a high-stakes lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) autonomous car division, Waymo, that threatens Uber’s self-driving car ambitions. “I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors’ request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,” Kalanick said in an email to employees that was seen by Reuters. Kalanick’s departure as CEO widens an already gaping hole at the top of Uber which has no chief financial officer, head of engineering or general counsel at the moment. For now, 14 people who reported to Kalanick are running Uber. It is not clear who will be Uber’s new CEO, but the next leader will likely be tasked with making the company profitable and paving the way to an initial public offering, said executive recruiters. “They need someone who is willing to walk into this mess, and be the single adult in this room for awhile until the rest of the executive team is in place,” said Steve Nilsen, a partner at executive search firm Boyden. The pursuit of a CEO puts the more than three-months-old search for a chief operating officer on hold, according to a source close to the board. The CEO must be hired first, the person said, and he or she will be key to figuring out the remaining positions to fill. Uber declined comment. Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has been identified as a target in media reports, but a source close to Sandberg told Reuters she plans to stay at the online social media company. “TOXIC CULTURE” Kalanick, who will remain on Uber’s board, will likely have some sway over the new CEO. He still wields significant power in the board room, made possible by a dual-class share structure that gives him and key allies 10 votes per share. Ultimately, it was some of Uber’s main investors who forced Kalanick out, according to a source familiar with the matter. Venture capital firm Benchmark, whose partner Bill Gurley is one of Uber’s largest shareholders, plus investors First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments, all pressed Kalanick to quit. A source close to Menlo Ventures, which led one of Uber’s early financing rounds, told Reuters that the firm helped write a letter calling for Kalanick to step down. FILE PHOTO - Uber CEO Travis Kalanick attends the summer World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China, June 26, 2016. REUTERS/Shu Zhang/File PhotoThe investors delivered the letter to Kalanick while he was in Chicago, the New York Times reported, citing people with knowledge of the situation. (nyti.ms/2soTB79) Kalanick’s decision “was a surprise to everyone”, a second Uber spokesman said. In a statement sent to Reuters, the Uber board of directors said Kalanick’s resignation “gives the company room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber’s history.” Gurley on Wednesday resigned from his influential board seat, a Benchmark spokeswoman said, signaling the departure of one of Kalanick’s closest confidants. He will be replaced by Benchmark general partner Matt Cohler. The board got a second new member on Wednesday in David Trujillo of TPG Capital, an Uber investor, according to a source familiar with the matter. Trujillo replaces David Bonderman, a co-founder of TPG who resigned from the board last week after making a sexist remark during an all-staff meeting called to discuss the results of an investigation into sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder led that investigation, which concluded that Kalanick’s authority should be reduced and that board oversight and independence should increase. Uber hired Holder’s firm Covington and Burling to look into its culture and workplace practices after a female former employee, Susan Fowler, publicly accused the company of sexual harassment. In addition, Uber fired 20 employees for incidents involving discrimination, sexual harassment and other bad behavior earlier this month. Uber “is the very definition of a toxic leadership culture” and Kalanick “set the tone”, said Jason Hanold, chief executive officer and managing partner at human resources executive recruitment firm Hanold Associates. SWEEPING POWER Following the release of the Covington report, Kalanick said last week he would take a leave of absence to grieve for his mother, who died recently in a boating accident that also seriously injured his father, and to work on his leadership skills. “Uber couldn’t make a credible claim that it was committed to the changes it has to make if he was hovering in the wings, waiting to return as CEO,” said Erik Gordon, a technology and entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Kalanick and other executives were also criticized for the handling of a crisis in India after an Uber driver was arrested for raping a passenger. Though the driver was convicted in 2015, Kalanick and other executives became convinced the crime was a set up by a local rival, former employees said. Eric Alexander, the head of Asian business for Uber, shared medical records internally, including with Kalanick. Alexander argued they showed the woman had been assaulted but not raped, people who spoke to him said. Alexander was fired earlier this month. Even some of Kalanick’s staunchest allies have found fault with how Uber has been run. In a blog post on Medium published on Tuesday, Uber co-founder Garrett Camp, who has long aligned himself with Kalanick, called Uber’s problems serious. “Over the years we have neglected parts of our culture as we have focused on growth. We have failed to build some of the systems that every company needs to scale successfully,” Camp wrote. In March, following the start of the Holder investigation, Uber director Arianna Huffington said on a call with reporters the board had full confidence in Kalanick. She repeated that position on Friday in an interview with Reuters by saying Kalanick’s leave of absence was solely his decision. Slideshow (3 Images)Benchmark’s Gurley praised the CEO on Twitter following his resignation. “There will be many pages in the history books devoted to @travisk - very few entrepreneurs have had such a lasting impact on the world,” Gurley wrote.

Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product. “Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,” Smith said. “My grandmother uses our product today.” The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention. Last week, American International Group Inc (AIG.N) announced a blockchain-based insurance product. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology. While far from mainstream, digital currency has enjoyed growing popularity that Smith attributes to the instability of traditional currencies in places such as Brazil, and political uncertainty in Britain and the United States. The day after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Smith said, Blockchain had the second-highest number of new users sign up in a single day. “In you’re in an environment of rapidly deteriorating geopolitical stability,” Smith said, “you are open to new ideas and new products.” (1 British pound = $1.2686) Reporting by Heather Somerville; Editing by Bill RigbyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators hit Google with a record 2.4-billion-euro ($2.7 billion) fine for favouring its own shopping service, taking a tough line in the first of three probes of its dominance in searches and smartphone operating systems. It is the biggest fine the European Commission has ever imposed on a single company in an antitrust case, exceeding a 1.06-billion-euro sanction handed down against U.S. chipmaker Intel in 2009 and goes far beyond what U.S. regulators have ever fined a tech company. European Union competition chief Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday gave Google 90 days to stop favouring its own shopping service in internet searches or face a further daily penalty of up to 5 percent of parent company Alphabet’s average daily global revenue. “Google’s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn’t just about attracting customers. It wasn’t just about making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine,” she told a news conference. The fine will be easy for the world’s biggest search engine to absorb, but Google must now move fast to satisfy Vestager’s concerns while limiting the longer-term hit to its highly lucractive search business. It also leaves other tech companies wondering how far Vestager may go to force U.S. tech giants to concede more ground to smaller competitors. Vestager has become one of the world’s most combative antitrust regulators with powers to impose multi-billion dollar fines and force companies to make radical changes to their businesses. Last year, the former Danish economy minister ordered Apple to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of 13 billion euros as it ruled the company had received illegal state aid. Apple is appealing the decision. The decision is the first of a series of competition rulings that Google faces from the European Commission, which has not shrunk from taking on U.S. tech giants such as Alphabet, which has annual revenues of $90 billion and a market value of $665 billion. The Commission has also charged Google with using its Android mobile operating system to crush rivals, a case that could potentially be the most damaging for the company, as it is the system used in most smartphones. The company has also been accused of blocking rivals in online search advertising. RIVALS DEMOTED The Commission found that Google, with a market share in searches of over 90 percent in most European countries, had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results. Vestager said in a statement that Google had “denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.” Google said its data showed people preferred links taking them directly to products they want and not to websites where they have to repeat their search. “We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission’s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, said in a statement. Alphabet, whose shares were down about 1 percent, said in a separate statement it would review the Commission’s formal decision but expected to accrue the fine in the second quarter. The biggest risk to Google is not the fine but the changes demanded to its business, said Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile companies. Google will have to brief the Commission on what measures it plans to take within 60 days of the decision and present periodic reports. Eight complainants were involved in the case which the EU declined to name in line with its policy. According to Windsor’s calculations, the 2.42-billion-euro fine represents just 22.6 days of the operating cash flow that Alphabet reported in its latest quarter. “What has the potential to hurt Google and be far more damaging is what remedies the European Commission may or may not impose on Google as a result,” Windsor said. “That’s where the real damage could be done.” The fine, equivalent to 3 percent of Alphabet’s revenue, is the biggest regulatory setback for Google, which settled with U.S. enforcers in 2013 without a penalty after agreeing to change some of its search practices. The Commission’s action follows a seven-year investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals such as U.S. consumer review website Yelp, TripAdvisor, UK price comparison site Foundem, News Corp and lobbying group FairSearch. News Corp said it applauded “the European Commission’s leadership in confronting the discriminatory behavior of Google in the comparison shopping industry.” “We strongly believe that the abuse of algorithms by dominant digital platforms should be of concern to every country and company seeking a fair, competitive and creative society,” it said in a statement, accusing Google of profiting from “commodifying content and enabling the proliferation of flawed and fake news.” The penalty payment for failure to comply would amount to around $12 million a day based on Alphabet’s 2016 turnover of $90.3 billion. “This decision is a game-changer. The Commission confirmed that consumers do not see what is most relevant for them on the world’s most used search engine but rather what is best for Google,” said Monique Goyens, director general of EU consumer group BEUC. Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, welcomed the Commission’s findings and urged it to act on Google’s Android mobile operating system following its 2013 complaint that Google restricted competition in software running on mobile devices.

Attendees wait for the program to begin during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Beck DiefenbachAfter a seven-year investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals, the European Commission hit Google with a record 2.4 billion euro ($2.73 billion) fine for favoring its own shopping service and an order to treat rival services the same way it treats its own products. “When I saw this yesterday, it absolutely rang a bell,” said Georg Berrisch, a partner at Baker Botts who advised Microsoft in its EU regulatory dispute while at another law firm. The European Commission slapped a 497 million euro fine on Microsoft in 2004 and ordered it to take steps to boost software competition. It failed to comply with that decision and was subsequently fined 899 million euros. In total, its battle with the EU in several other investigations cost it more than 2.2 billion euros in penalties. In an oblique reference to Microsoft, which faced nearly two decades of legal scrutiny for antitrust violations, Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told a 2011 U.S. Senate hearing: “We get it. By that I mean, we get the lessons of our corporate predecessors.” But Google has much to learn, said Stephen Kinsella at law firm Sidley Austin, who advises Google complainant and UK online shopping comparison website Kelkoo. “Years ago Google said they wouldn’t make the mistakes that Microsoft did. Instead they made all of them and came up with a few of their own. The public statements yesterday show they still don’t get it,” he said. Google said on Tuesday it disagreed with the EU’s findings that it had abused its dominant position and was considering an appeal. It said it looked forward to continuing to make its case. “The real danger for Google is to enter into a prolonged battle with the Commission on whether what it has done is sufficient to comply with its decision. It could be quite expensive for Google in the end. This is not the end of the story,” Berrisch said. Underlining Google’s task, the Commission on Wednesday published a tender for technical expertise to assist it with the case. The five-year contract is worth 10 million euros and can be renewed. So far, investors have given Google the benefit of the doubt, with Alphabet ranking just behind Apple (AAPL.O) as the world’s most valuable stock with a $666 billion market capitalization. But they are taking note. “The real concern is whether the Commission will manage to force Google to change its business model, its algorithms in a way that could be detrimental to the business,” said Wesley Lebeau, fund manager at CPR Asset Management, an Amundi company. “Search engine is still about 60 percent of Alphabet’s valuation so that is a big deal, even though the drivers for future growth are YouTube and all the Alphabet companies — Waymo, NEST, Verily,” he said. Tech titans have benefited so far from the perception that they bring benefits to society, said Freddie Lait, founder at Latitude Investment Management. “But there is a small chance that, if the shine wears off and you have more of these terrorist videos...and the fine is a huge fine, which sent a message to consumers that there’s been wrongdoing,” he said. “If the shine comes off, the claws are out from regulators and governments to try and get their pound of flesh out of all of the big tech companies.” Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in Frankfurt, Simon Jessop and Sophie Sassard in LondonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager holds a news conference at the EU Commission's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 27, 2017. REUTERS/Francois LenoirThe ruling opens the door for further regulatory actions against more crucial parts of Google’s business – mobile phones, online ad buying and specialised search categories like travel - while easing the standard of proof for rivals to mount civil lawsuits showing Google has harmed them. So far, investors have shrugged off the EU’s threatened crackdown, with Google’s holding company Alphabet’s shares down 1.8 percent in early U.S. trade amid a continued selloff in technology stocks. The stock has doubled in the two years since European authorities vigorously stepped up investigations of it. It trades just behind rival Apple as the world’s most valuable stock with a $666 billion market capitalisation. The real sting is not from the fine for anti-competitive practices in shopping search but the way the EU has thrown the issue back to Google to solve, meaning the company won’t be able to comply through an easy set of technical steps. In effect, the Commission is forcing Google to demonstrate that rivals have made substantial inroads into its businesses before there is much chance of it being let off the regulatory hook. EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager promised Google was in for years of monitoring to guard against further abuses. “Just being put on notice can limit Google’s strategic options into the future,” said Matti Littunen, a digital media and online advertising analyst with Enders Analysis in London. The EU’s 2004 ruling that Microsoft Corp had abused its dominant market position in Windows and other markets is now seen as having curtailed the software giants moves over the subsequent decade to expand more quickly into emerging markets such as online advertising, opening the way for Google’s rise. Putting the onus on the company underlines regulators’ limited knowledge of modern technologies and their complexity, said Fordham Law School Professor Mark Patterson. “The decision shows the difficulty of regulating algorithm-based internet firms,” he said. “Antitrust remedies usually direct firms that have violated antitrust laws to stop certain behaviour or, less often, to implement particular fixes. “This decision just tells Google to apply ‘equal treatment,’ not how to do that”. WARNING SHOT The EU ruling is a warning shot for two on-going EU probes into Google’s Android mobile operating system and AdSense ad system, said Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile players, including Google. “If the European Union turns around and says Google can no longer bundle its Google Play app store as a default feature on many Android smartphones, this opens up the market to other handset makers to put their own software and services front and centre on their phones,” he said. Littunen of Enders Analysis agreed, saying while Google may be able to meet EU objections in the AdSense case by making relatively modest changes to its advertising systems to enable website customers to run ads from Google advertising rivals, the Android case has many complicated factors with no easy solution. More importantly, Google must find ways change its business practices without harming its very lucrative advertising business model, which accounted for around 85 percent of the $90.3 billion in revenue of parent company Alphabet in 2016. “The EU’s identification of ‘super-dominance’ in internet search throughout the European Economic Area is confirmed and will provide a cornerstone for assessment of other ongoing cases, especially regarding Android and AdSense,” said Jonas Koponen, competition chief at Linklaters law firm in Brussels. “This could result in a profound change to the company’s business models,” he predicted.

"DETROIT (Reuters) - Baidu Inc, the top Chinese internet search firm, has formed a broad alliance to promote self-driving cars, pitting its Apollo platform against Alphabet Inc’s system, it said on Wednesday, in hopes of getting the vehicles on the road in China by 2019. A fleet of vehicles equipped with Baidu’s autonomous driving technologies conduct road testing in Wuzhen, Zhejiang Province, China in an undated photo. Courtesy of Baidu/Handout via REUTERS The alliance includes partnerships with automakers, suppliers, startups, universities and local governments and is built around Baidu’s Apollo self-driving platform, which was developed at its tech center in California’s Silicon Valley. Apollo is aimed at Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving package. Among the key development partners on Apollo are Nvidia Corp, which specializes in microprocessors and artificial intelligence, and mapping expert TomTom NV. In mid-morning trade, Nvidia shares were up 2.6 percent to $142.94 and Baidu U.S. shares rose 2.3 percent to $184.15. In Amsterdam, TomTom was up 3.2 percent to 8.85 euros. Ford Motor Co and Daimler AG also are partners, Baidu said, as well as supplier Delphi Automotive and chipmaker Intel Corp. Baidu said at a briefing in Beijing it is partnering with five Chinese vehicle manufacturers, including Chery Automobile [CHERY.UL], BAIC Motor, FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL], Chongqing Changan Automobile and Great Wall Motor. All but Great Wall are state-owned. German suppliers Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], Continental Automotive and ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] are also part of the alliance. Baidu has said its goal is to get self-driving vehicles on the road in China, possibly by 2019, and eventually in other markets, including the United States. Baidu is an investor in Nio, a Silicon Valley electric vehicle startup also backed by China’s Tencent Holdings and Lenovo. Nio hopes to put its first self-driving cars on U.S. roads in 2020. Two weeks ago, top officials from Baidu and Chery met in Silicon Valley to sign an agreement to collaborate on the development of intelligent, internet-connected vehicles, according to a source familiar with the companies’ plans.

"DETROIT (Reuters) - Baidu Inc, the top Chinese internet search firm, has formed a broad alliance to promote self-driving cars, pitting its Apollo platform against Alphabet Inc’s system, it said on Wednesday, in hopes of getting the vehicles on the road in China by 2019. A fleet of vehicles equipped with Baidu’s autonomous driving technologies conduct road testing in Wuzhen, Zhejiang Province, China in an undated photo. Courtesy of Baidu/Handout via REUTERS The alliance includes partnerships with automakers, suppliers, startups, universities and local governments and is built around Baidu’s Apollo self-driving platform, which was developed at its tech center in California’s Silicon Valley. Apollo is aimed at Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving package. Among the key development partners on Apollo are Nvidia Corp, which specializes in microprocessors and artificial intelligence, and mapping expert TomTom NV. In mid-morning trade, Nvidia shares were up 2.6 percent to $142.94 and Baidu U.S. shares rose 2.3 percent to $184.15. In Amsterdam, TomTom was up 3.2 percent to 8.85 euros. Ford Motor Co and Daimler AG also are partners, Baidu said, as well as supplier Delphi Automotive and chipmaker Intel Corp. Baidu said at a briefing in Beijing it is partnering with five Chinese vehicle manufacturers, including Chery Automobile [CHERY.UL], BAIC Motor, FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL], Chongqing Changan Automobile and Great Wall Motor. All but Great Wall are state-owned. German suppliers Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], Continental Automotive and ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] are also part of the alliance. Baidu has said its goal is to get self-driving vehicles on the road in China, possibly by 2019, and eventually in other markets, including the United States. Baidu is an investor in Nio, a Silicon Valley electric vehicle startup also backed by China’s Tencent Holdings and Lenovo. Nio hopes to put its first self-driving cars on U.S. roads in 2020. Two weeks ago, top officials from Baidu and Chery met in Silicon Valley to sign an agreement to collaborate on the development of intelligent, internet-connected vehicles, according to a source familiar with the companies’ plans. Chery has installed Baidu’s self-driving software in several prototype cars in China and they could further deepen their relationship to include manufacturing.

"OSLO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google unit expects to receive its first wind power from Norway by early September, the company told Reuters on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: A view shows a wind turbine in Champdeniers, France, March 14, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau - RTX31388Tellenes wind farm, a 50-turbine strong wind farm of 160-megawatt (MW) capacity that is currently under development, will become Norway’s largest wind farm and Google’s biggest in Europe. “We’ll purchase power as soon as the wind farm becomes fully operational, which we expect will take place in early September 2017,” a Google spokesman told Reuters. Google last year signed a 12-year deal to buy 100 percent of the plant’s output. The company, which has four European data centers in Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland, said the wind power will be used to supply one or several of them. The Tellenes wind farm’s first turbine will begin to generate power by next week, said Olav Rommetveit, a spokesman for farm maker Zephyr, although Google will not receive the initial output. “Google will not immediately get the supply. It has an exclusive contract for 12 years and they will begin getting the electricity at some point after commercial operations begins,” said Rommetveit. The electricity produced until Google starts receiving the farm’s full capacity, will be sold on the Nord Pool power exchange, he added. BlackRock (BLK.N), which provided the project’s equity financing, confirmed the first turbine would be ready for production next week and said power sales would start a few days later. Arise (ARISE.ST), a Swedish wind power company, will be the farm’s operator. Google has also bought the future output of a smaller wind farm in Sweden, due to start operation in 2018, bringing the total capacity of its renewable power purchases in Europe to 500 MW, the company said.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The shortage of housing in California’s Silicon Valley has gotten so severe that Facebook Inc on Friday proposed taking homebuilding into its own hands for the first time with a plan to construct 1,500 units near its headquarters. Architectural rendering of Facebook’s proposed Willow Campus is seen in Menlo Park, California, U.S. in this undated photo obtained by Reuters July 7, 2017. The goal for the Willow Campus is to create an integrated, mixed-use village that will provide housing, transit solutions, office space that includes new retail space, a grocery store, pharmacy and additional community-facing retail. Facebook/Handout via REUTERS The growth of Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s Google and other tech companies has strained neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay area that were not prepared for an influx of tens of thousands of workers during the past decade. Home prices and commute times have risen. Tech companies have responded with measures such as internet-equipped buses for employees with long commutes. Facebook has offered at least $10,000 in incentives to workers who move closer to its offices. Those steps, though, have not reduced complaints that tech companies are making communities unaffordable, and they have mostly failed to address the area’s housing shortage. “The problem with Silicon Valley is you don’t have enough supply to keep up with the demand,” said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at real estate research firm CoreLogic. With Facebook’s construction plan, the company said it wanted to invest in Menlo Park, the city some 45 miles (72 km) south of San Francisco where it moved in 2011. The company said it wants to build a “village” that will also have 1.75 million square feet of office space and 125,000 square feet of retail space. “Part of our vision is to create a neighborhood center that provides long-needed community services,” John Tenanes, Facebook’s vice president for global facilities, said in a statement. The 1,500 Facebook housing units would be open to anyone, not just employees, and 15 percent of them would be offered at below market rates, the company said. Facebook said it expects the review process to take two years. Alphabet has taken a smaller step, buying 300 modular apartment units for short-term employee housing, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. Menlo Park Mayor Kirsten Keith said in an interview that there were concerns about whether the Facebook plan would increase traffic, a subject the city’s planning department would study. She said, though, that Facebook’s plan fits with the city’s own long-term plan for development, and that the city was excited about the additional housing. Facebook’s Tenanes said the density of the proposed development could also entice spending on transit projects. “The region’s failure to continue to invest in our transportation infrastructure alongside growth has led to congestion and delay,” he said.

The “Voyager” tool allows internet surfers to take interactive tours of exotic destinations on Google Earth led by the likes of primatologist Jane Goodall, with photos, information and maps. However, regular users will be able to create their own unedited content for private or public use within two to three years, Google Earth Director Rebecca Moore told Reuters. “The story of your family history, the story of your favorite hiking trip – it could be anything. It doesn’t have to be profound,” she said at the event in Sao Paulo. Moore took the stage at an event in Sao Paulo to unveil the “I am the Amazon” project, which has mapped 11 sites to document the relationship between the rainforest and its people, touching on topics like food, water and cultural origins. To tell the stories of communities such as the Yanomami people, Cinta Larga and the Boa Vista Quilombola, Google and partners used tools like 3D cameras to accompany satellite images with videos and text. Moore did not reveal the budget for the project but she ruled out the idea of advertising on the platform and said it is not Google’s intention to turn a profit from the venture. “Google Earth is our gift to the world,” she told Reuters. “In terms of budget, Google has nice revenue from advertising, and not everything Google does has to make money.” Reporting Natália Scalzaretto; Editing by Lisa ShumakerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"FILE PHOTO: Electric cars are seen at a parking lot of an automobile factory in Xingtai, Hebei province, China April 26, 2016. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo DETROIT (Reuters) - Chinese automakers are on track to produce 49 of the 103 new electric car models that will be launched globally by 2020, as part of China’s push to accelerate the switch to battery power from oil, according to a new forecast released on Wednesday. U.S. consulting firm AlixPartners also said China is aiming to have nearly two-thirds of the world’s manufacturing capacity for lithium-ion batteries by 2021, and is investing to support current sales of domestic-brand electric vehicles in the world’s largest car market. Already, Chinese automakers account for 96 percent of the electric vehicles sold in the country, AlixPartners said. Automakers sold about 350,000 electric vehicles in China in 2016 - still less than 2 percent of total vehicle sales. By 2025, electric vehicle batteries should be close to even with internal combustion engines in terms of production costs, AlixPartners forecast. Lower battery costs could help boost consumer acceptance. John Hoffecker, the firm’s global vice chairman, told reporters at the Automotive Press Association in Detroit on Tuesday that other factors, such as a significant reduction of the time it takes to recharge electric car batteries, will be critical to efforts to win over reluctant consumers. AlixPartners also cautioned that many of the roughly 50 companies it counts as contestants in the race to develop self-driving cars won’t go the distance. “It’s impossible to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle companies,” Hoffecker said. In the United States, AlixPartners said automakers will have to contend with funding investments in new technology against deep-pocketed technology industry players such as Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc, even as sales of cars and light trucks slide into a cyclical trough. AlixPartners is forecasting that U.S. car and light truck sales will fall to 15.2 million vehicles in 2019, down 13 percent from the 2016 peak. Other U.S. analysts also predict a slowdown in vehicle sales during the next two to three years.

The new offering is called “Google Feed,” a name that may conjure comparisons to Facebook’s “News Feed,” a feature on Facebook used to browse updates from friends, family and other sources. Google said, however, that it was not trying to duplicate Facebook Inc (FB.O), the world’s largest social network. Instead, the company said it wanted to create another place to see a stream of relevant search results. “This feed is really about your interests ... It’s not really about what your friends are interested in,” Ben Gomes, a Google vice president for engineering, said in a briefing with reporters. Typical updates might include a link to a website with tips about an upcoming vacation spot, or a link to a page about cycling or another hobby, the company said. Facebook and Google are jockeying for attention online and by extension, for advertising revenue based on those eyeballs. The two Silicon Valley companies are expected to take in some 50 percent of overall online ad spending in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer. There were no immediate plans to include advertising in Google Feed, Gomes said. Google Feed will suggest links based on a user’s Google search history as well as data from other Google services, such as YouTube, Gmail and Google Calendar, the company said.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc’s Flash, a once-ubiquitous technology used to power most of the media content found online, will be retired at the end of 2020, the software company announced Tuesday.

After 2020, Adobe will stop releasing updates for Flash and web browsers will no longer support it. The companies are encouraging developers to migrate their software onto modern programming standards. “Few technologies have had such a profound and positive impact in the internet era,” said Govind Balakrishnan, vice president of product development for Adobe Creative Cloud. Created more than 20 years ago, Flash was once the preferred software used by developers to create games, video players and applications capable of running on multiple web browsers. When Adobe acquired Flash in its 2005 purchase of Macromedia, the technology was on more than 98 percent of personal computers connected to the web, Macromedia said at the time. But Flash’s popularity began to wane after Apple’s decision not to support it on the iPhone. In a public letter in 2010, late Apple CEO Steve Jobs criticized Flash’s reliability, security and performance. Since then, other technologies like HTML5 have emerged as alternatives to Flash. In the past year, several web browsers have begun to require users to enable Flash before running it. On Google’s Chrome, the most popular web browser, Flash’s usage has already fallen drastically. In 2014, Flash was used each day by 80 percent of desktop users. That number is now at 17 percent “and continues to decline,” Google said in a blog Tuesday. “This trend reveals that sites are migrating to open web technologies, which are faster and more power-efficient than Flash,” Google said. “They’re also more secure.” Flash, however, remains in use among some online gamers. Adobe said it will work with Facebook as well as Unity Technologies and Epic Games to help developers migrate their games.

A rising TAC - the cost of driving traffic to its site - is one of them."	"(Reuters) - There are very few things that make Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) investors unhappy. A rising TAC - the cost of driving traffic to its site - is one of them. FILE PHOTO: A man holds his smartphone which displays the Google home page, in this picture illustration taken in Bordeaux, Southwestern France, August 22, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File PhotoGoogle-parent Alphabet, which has enjoyed revenue growth rate of over 20 percent for the past five quarters, said on Monday that TAC, or traffic acquisition costs, jumped 28 percent to $5.09 billion in the second quarter. That is the highest percentage increase in TAC in nine years and analysts said they expect it to continue to weigh on margins even as the company’s fundamentals remain strong. Alphabet’s shares, which have surged 26 percent this year, slipped 3 percent in early trading on Tuesday. Google relies heavily on partners such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which has made Google the default search engine on the iPhone. It also pays websites to run ads. “The company continues to cite mobile and programmatic as drivers of overall increases in TAC, which we believe will likely continue to increase in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a client note. The company has warned that spending on traffic acquisition is expected to keep rising as a shift to mobile advertising continues and programmatic advertising - in which ads are bought, sold and displayed by automated systems - becomes more important. Traffic acquisition costs were 22 percent of advertising revenue in the second quarter. Net ad revenue rose 16 percent, compared with 18 percent last quarter. Canaccord Genuity said it expects TAC to jump to $21.07 billion in 2017, 25 percent higher than last year. It had risen 17 percent in 2016. “The light net ad revenue coupled with the recent run-up in GOOG’s share price are likely to cause a pullback,” Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice said. Despite concerns about TAC, most analysts remained upbeat about the company’s potential to keep growing revenue and profit at strong rates. “GOOGL’s 2Q highlights the still long advertising runway and robust innovation-driven revenue growth potential (search, YouTube, cloud, etc) ... we remain longterm bulls given GOOGL’s strong top-line momentum and reasonable valuation for growth,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.

Shares of McDonald’s surged 5 percent after the fast-food giant posted the biggest rise in sales at established restaurants globally in five years. Caterpillar’s shares rose 4.1 percent after the company reported quarterly results that smashed expectations and raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year. However, Alphabet fell 2.6 percent, after the tech giant warned that expenses would remain high as more searches shift to mobile devices. The S&P tech index has been the best performing sector this year and earnings from big tech companies will be closely watched to see if the rally has legs. Amazon and Facebook, part of the high-flying “FANG” stocks, report results later this week, while Apple is due to report next week. Earnings are expected to have climbed 8.8 percent in the second quarter, compared with an 8 percent rise estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Advanced Micro Devices, AT&T, Chipotle and Chubb are among the major companies that report after the closing bell. “Investors will have a lot to chew on today as earnings results include at least 12 major companies,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. “We look for another mixed session as the FOMC meeting begins and the health care vote comes into play.” At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 133.09 points, or 0.62 percent, at 21,646.26 and the S&P 500 was up 7.15 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,477.06. The Nasdaq Composite was down 13.74 points, or 0.21 percent, at 6,397.07. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index’s 1.45 percent rise leading the gainers. The Fed kicks off a two-day meeting later in the day to discuss its monetary stance and the timing of its long-awaited balance sheet reduction. While no rate hike is expected due to subdued inflation, the central bank’s statement on Wednesday will be parsed for clues on the pace of future rate hikes. Investors will also be keeping an eye on a Senate vote on a healthcare bill, with lawmakers voting on whether to push forward with repealing Obamacare or perhaps abandon it entirely. DuPont was up 2.3 percent after beating estimates for profit and results. Eli Lilly was down 3 percent, while 3M fell 4.3 percent after reporting results. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,805 to 751. On the Nasdaq, 1,429 issues rose and 869 fell.

Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube, said it made $3.5 billion in net income on sales of $26 billion. The profit would have been much larger but for a record $2.7 billion European Union antitrust fine. Still, the company noted that costs were rising faster than sales and warned that expenses would remain high as more searches shift to mobile devices. The squeeze on expected future profit appeared to weigh on Alphabet’s share price, which fell about 3 percent to $967 after the bell. Shares had closed up in regular trading and have gained 26 percent for the year. Alphabet’s cost of revenue, a measure of how much money the company must spend to keep its platforms running before added costs such as research, rose 28 percent, well above the growth in revenue itself. The rising costs, including what Google pays to drive traffic to its search engine, hurt operating margins more than most people had expected, said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management. “This could be problematic going forward,” Kass said. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, asked about margins during a conference call with analysts, said the company was focused on getting bigger. “As we’ve often said, we’re focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins,” she said. Increasing costs, Porat added, are a result of more money going into high-growth products that she said would create value for shareholders. With its latest profits, Alphabet reported $15.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and another $79 billion in marketable securities. Alphabet and social media rival Facebook Inc, which together dominate the online ad market, compete for advertising dollars. This year, Google is expected to have $73.75 billion in net digital ad revenue worldwide while Facebook is expected to take in $36.29 billion, according to research firm eMarketer. Together they will have about 49 percent of the market, eMarketer said. Facebook is due to report earnings on Wednesday. The technology sector has led a big rally in U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 information technology index is up 23.1 percent this year, compared with a 10.4 percent rise in the S&P 500. Antitrust risk has shadowed Google for years, and antitrust enforcers in the European Union last month fined Google 2.42 billion euro ($2.7 billion) for favoring its own shopping service. The fine came in the first of three EU probes of Google’s dominance in searches and smartphone operating systems, and analysts are going to monitor the downside closely, said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones. “It is not so much the money or the fine itself,” Olson said, but “questions linger about what impact that could have on Google’s Europe business, and they did not really comment on that.” U.S. antitrust enforcers thus far have chosen not to follow Europe’s lead. If not for the fine, Alphabet said that earnings per share would have been $8.90 in the second quarter, compared with $7 a year earlier. With the fine, Alphabet reported earnings per share of $5.01, beating an average estimate of $4.49. Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google, said in response to an analyst question during Monday’s call that Google would fight to continue bundling its Android operating system with popular smartphone apps such as Google Maps — a practice the EU antitrust officials are investigating. “It’s a very open market, open ecosystem, and it works well for everyone, and I expect that to continue,” Pichai said, adding that billions of people use Google products. Pichai was also appointed to the Alphabet board of directors on Monday.

Revenue from other Google products, a category that includes the Pixel smartphone, the Play Store and Google’s cloud business, rose 42.3 percent to $3.09 billion.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Line Corp said its number of monthly active users fell from the previous quarter, its first such decline, underscoring the messaging app operator’s struggles to grow outside its home country since last year’s high-profile IPO. While Line’s messaging app, known for electronic stickers of a brown bear and his rabbit girlfriend, is popular in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia, the company has lost out to rival apps in many other countries.

It said on Wednesday that monthly active user numbers for its main markets dropped to 169 million from 171 million, although first-half profit was boosted by an asset sale. The decline in average monthly users was in Indonesia - its first-ever drop in that country, the company said, adding that users in Japan rose on the previous quarter.

"LAGOS (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google aims to train 10 million people in Africa in online skills over the next five years in an effort to make them more employable, its chief executive said on Thursday. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai (L) speaks during an interview with journalist Adesuwa Onyenokwe during a conference tagged 'Google for Nigeria' in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos, July 27, 2017. REUTERS/Akintunde AkinleyeThe U.S. technology giant also hopes to train 100,000 software developers in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, a company spokeswoman said. Google’s pledge marked an expansion of an initiative it launched in April 2016 to train young Africans in digital skills. It announced in March it had reached its initial target of training one million people. The company is “committing to prepare another 10 million people for jobs of the future in the next five years,” Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told a company conference in Nigeria’s commercial capital of Lagos. Google said it will offer a combination of in-person and online training. Google has said on its blog that it carries out the training in languages including Swahili, Hausa and Zulu and tries to ensure that at least 40 percent of people trained are women. It did not say how much the program cost. Africa, with its rapid population growth, falling data costs and heavy adoption of mobile phones, having largely leapfrogged personal computer use, is tempting for tech companies. Executives such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s chairman Jack Ma have also recently toured parts of the continent. But countries like Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, which Google said it would initially target for its mobile developer training, may not offer as much opportunity as the likes of China and India for tech firms. Yawning wealth gaps mean that much of the population in places like Nigeria has little disposable income, while mobile adoption tends to favor more basic phone models. Combined with bad telecommunications infrastructure, that can mean slower and less internet surfing, which tech firms rely on to make money. Google also announced plans to provide more than $3 million in equity-free funding, mentorship and working space access to more than 60 African start-ups over three years. In addition, YouTube will roll out a new app, YouTube Go, aimed at improving video streaming over slow networks, said Johanna Wright, vice president of YouTube. YouTube Go is being tested in Nigeria as of June, and the trial version of the app will be offered globally later this year, she said.

Shares in Facebook, owner of four of the most popular mobile services in the world, rose more than 4 percent to about $173 in after-hours trading. Through Wednesday’s close, the stock price had climbed nearly 44 percent this year. Facebook, which now has more than 2 billion regular users, has been squeezing more ads into its Facebook News Feed while adding more ads to its photo-sharing app Instagram, which has more than 700 million users. With money cascading from those two services, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company was turning attention to monetizing its two messaging services, Messenger and WhatsApp, which have more than 1 billion users each. “I want to see us move a little faster here but I’m confident that we’re going to get this right over the long term,” Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts. The company also is accelerating its push into video, an effort aimed at taking advertising dollars from the television industry and increasing the time people spend on Facebook. Within weeks, Facebook is expected to start a video service that will include scripted shows, a sharp change for a business built on user-generated content. Zuckerberg said video would be a significant driver of Facebook’s business in the next two to three years. With those possibilities still on the horizon, Facebook said total revenue rose 44.8 percent to $9.32 billion in the second quarter of the year. That beat the average forecast of $9.20 billion among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Growth was even steeper in mobile advertising, which increased to nearly $8 billion. “In mobile we’re continuing to see great strengths,” Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in a phone interview with Reuters. “We’re seeing more and more ad dollars getting allocated to mobile, and we think that trend will continue.” “KILLING IT ON MOBILE” Mobile ad revenue accounted for 87 percent of the company’s total advertising revenue of $9.16 billion in the latest quarter, up from 84 percent a year earlier. “They’re killing it on mobile,” Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin said, referring to Facebook’s suite of apps. “They are the de facto mobile advertising monopolies and that’s a really big deal.” Martin said she sees no weaknesses in Facebook’s business. Facebook and Alphabet Inc own half of the online advertising market worldwide, and Facebook’s revenue growth this quarter outshone Alphabet, the owner of YouTube and Google. Alphabet on Monday reported a 21 percent increase in quarterly revenue, although it started the quarter from a larger base than Facebook did. Facebook has not said how much of its revenue is attributable to its Instagram unit, although the photo-sharing app has become a greater focus of its business. “Clearly, the biggest driver of growth is, overall, Facebook News Feed,” Wehner said. “Instagram is making a contribution and an increasing contribution.” But investors want Facebook to find additional revenue streams because the company has warned it is hitting maximum ad load in the News Feed, potentially slowing its overall growth. So far that has not happened. “They kept warning about ad load, but the ad load continues to be strong,” said Ivan Feinseth, research director at Tigress Financial Partners. “I still think ad revenue will grow, because more advertisers are adapting to this platform because there are so many people out there.” FILE PHOTO - The Facebook logo is displayed on the company's website in an illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France on February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo The popularity of Instagram also has put pressure on Snapchat, the app owned by Snap Inc. Instagram has added features similar to Snapchat’s and Snap’s stock on Wednesday closed at an all-time low of $13.40. Facebook said about 2.01 billion people were using its service monthly as of June 30, up 17 percent from a year earlier. For the second quarter, net income attributable to shareholders rose to $3.89 billion, or $1.32 per share, from $2.28 billion, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.

"Aug 7 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google has fired an employee who wrote an internal memo that ascribed gender inequality in the technology industry to biological differences. James Damore, the engineer who wrote the memo, confirmed his dismissal saying that he had been fired for “perpetuating gender stereotypes,” in an email to Reuters on Monday. Damore said he is exploring all possible legal remedies. Google said it could not talk about individual employee cases. “Distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership,” James wrote in an internal company memo last week. “Portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,” Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in an internal email viewed by Reuters on Monday. The memo stoked a heated debate over treatment of women in the male-dominated Silicon Valley that has boiled for months following sexual harassment scandals at Uber Technologies Inc and several venture capital firms. Google’s vice president of diversity, Danielle Brown, sent a memo in response to the furor, saying the engineer’s essay “advanced incorrect assumptions about gender.” (Reporting by Ishita Palli in Bengaluru and David Ingram in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Ride services company Uber Technologies Inc’s [UBER.UL] head of operations, Ryan Graves, a long-time ally of former chief executive Travis Kalanick, is stepping down from his full-time job at the company, according to a copy of a letter from Graves seen by Reuters. FILE PHOTO: Travis Kalanick (L) and Uber's head of global operations Ryan Graves (R) eat with fourth graders Viktor Marchis-Vacker (2nd L) and Snit Tecle (2nd R) during Cooking Matters, a nutrition class taught by 18 Reasons, a local partner of Share our Strength at Glen Park Elementary School in San Francisco, California, December 10, 2014. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Graves will continue to serve on Uber’s board, it said. The company is looking for a new chief executive after Kalanick was pressured to step down, following a series of business embarrassments for Uber. There has been some speculation that Kalanick could return to the top job, but events this week cast doubt on that possibility. Graves said that he preferred to make his own move before the new leader was chosen. “It’s really important to me that this transition doesn’t take away from the importance of the onboarding process of our new CEO, whoever that might be,” he wrote. Earlier this week another longtime Kalanick ally, co-founder Garrett Camp, sent a memo to employees saying that “Travis is not returning as CEO,” according to a copy obtained by tech website Recode. Kalanick, Camp and Graves together hold a significant voting stake in Uber. Kalanick’s pugnacious style largely defined Uber’s approach and helped it become a transportation colossus valued at $68 billion, the largest private firm backed by venture capitalists in the world. But that brashness has also been blamed for a string of scandals this year, from the unearthing of a culture of sexism and bullying at Uber to a U.S. Department of Justice federal investigation and a high-stakes lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) autonomous car division, Waymo, that threatens Uber’s self-driving car ambitions. Graves was one of the first employees at Uber. His memo was reported earlier by CNBC.

Damore has since become a hero to some on the far right, who have attacked what they characterize as politically correct groupthink in Silicon Valley. Damore claimed in a complaint filed on Monday to the National Labor Relations Board that he had been subject to “coercive statements” at Google. In the email on Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said some company employees were being named personally on websites in relation to the incident, according to Recode. “Googlers are writing in, concerned about their safety and worried they may be ‘outed’ publicly for asking a question in the Town Hall,” Pichai wrote. Google did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Weber; Editing by Leslie Adler)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Closely-watched U.S. hedge fund managers were generally bearish on the FAANG group of high-flying tech stocks in the second quarter, with eight such investors in aggregate cutting or liquidating 18 stakes in the companies, regulatory filings showed. FILE PHOTO: The Facebook application icon on a phone screen, August 3, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/File PhotoThe group comprises Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), each of which have roughly followed broader U.S. indexes including the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX, Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite .IXIC to record highs in recent months. A Reuters analysis of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Coatue Management, Omega Advisors, Third Point, Tiger Global Management, Appaloosa Management, Paulson & Co, Soros Fund Management and Greenlight Capital in aggregate slashed 16 stakes, sold two stakes, increased six stakes, opened two new stakes, and maintained two positions in the so-called FAANG stocks in the three months ended June 30. Daniel Loeb’s Third Point increased its stake in Alphabet by 120,000 class A shares to 575,000 and increased its position in Facebook by 500,000 class A shares to 3.5 million in the second quarter, according to the filings. Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors took a generally bearish stance overall and cut its stake in Facebook by 26,700 class A shares to 236,200. It also cut its stake in Netflix by 12,700 shares to 65,000 shares and trimmed its stake in Amazon by 8,900 shares to 10,500 shares. Omega kept its stake in Alphabet of 158,835 class A shares unchanged. Cooperman told CNBC last week that Alphabet was his biggest position and that his investment in the company’s shares amounted to about 4-4.5 percent of his fund. Soros Fund Management sold its entire stake in Alphabet of 1,300 class A shares, cut its stake in Facebook Inc by 161,373 class A shares to 476,713, sold its entire stake in Netflix of 131,966 shares, but took a new stake in Amazon of 7,500 shares. Tiger Global Management, led by Chase Coleman, cut its stake in Amazon by 110,120 shares to 1.2 million shares and trimmed its stake in Netflix by 52,600 shares to 376,400. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management trimmed its stake in Netflix by 17,909 shares to 3 million shares. Coatue cut its stake in Apple by 46,060 shares to 2.9 million shares, while David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital also cut its position by 42,400 shares to 3.9 mln shares. John Paulson’s Paulson & Co took a new stake, however, of 12,300 shares and David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management increased its stake by 325,000 shares to 625,000. All of the FAANG stocks rose in the second quarter, with Alphabet surging the most - by 9.7 percent - and Apple the least at a meager 0.3 percent. All of the stocks have built on gains so far in the third quarter, with Netflix gaining the most at 14.5 percent and Alphabet the least at 1 percent. Daniel Morgan, who helps manage about $12 billion at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, said the firm owned all of the FAANG stocks, with the smallest position being Netflix. He said the streaming video company was vulnerable to stiff competition. “I’m kind of worried that, five years from now, we’re not going to be talking about Netflix like we don’t go and drop our discs off at Blockbuster anymore,” Morgan said. “There are enough issues out there to keep us from having it as a large position.” Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Tom BrownOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Four Uber drivers [UBER.UL] were fined by a Danish court on Monday for operating taxis illegally while working for the ride hailing service before it withdrew from the market in April. FILE PHOTO: The Uber logo is seen on a screen in Singapore August 4, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White /File Photo The four men, one of whom was fined 486,500 Danish crowns ($78,060), were charged in March for failing to have permits and for violating a law introduced in February that imposed extra rules on taxis operating in Denmark, police said. Another 1,500 Uber drivers also faced charges of illegally operating taxis, Vibeke Thorkil-Jensen, head of public prosecution for Copenhagen police, told Reuters. She did not give further details about the charges. After launching its service in Denmark in 2014, Uber was criticised by taxi driver unions, companies and politicians who said the firm posed unfair competition by not meeting legal standards required for established taxi firms. Parliament passed a law in February 2017 that introduced more stringent requirements on taxis, such as mandatory fare meters and seat sensors. The new rules prompted Uber’s withdrawal. Union officials said Uber had operated illegally even before the new law was passed. In November, a student was fined for failure to have a permit while working for Uber. In Monday’s ruling, one of the four drivers was fined 486,500 crowns for making 5,427 illegal taxi rides with Uber in 2015, Copenhagen district court said in a statement. Three others were fined between 40,000 and 110,000 crowns, it said. “We are very disappointed for the drivers involved and our top priority is to support them during this difficult time,” said an Uber spokeswoman. She said it welcomed regulations in Denmark but there was a “clear need for modern regulations”. A lawyer acting for the drivers said at least three of the men would appeal their conviction, the Danish news agency Ritzau reported. Reuters could not immediately reach the four drivers or lawyers acting for them. Uber, whose drivers have faced criticism from traditional taxi operators in other markets around the world, picked Expedia boss Dara Khosrowshahi as its new chief executive replacing co-founder Travis Kalanick. Kalanick resigned in June, under pressure following accounts of a corporate culture of sexism and bullying, as well as a U.S. Department of Justice federal investigation filed by Alphabet Inc’s autonomous car division.

"Recruiters for Lyft wait for the opening of a job fair in Golden, Colorado, June 7, 2017. REUTERS/Rick Wilking SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A self-driving car will soon be one ride option available from Lyft in the San Francisco Bay Area, as the ride-services company ramps up its efforts to become a serious player in autonomous vehicle technology. Lyft said on Thursday that self-driving cars will soon be dispatched to certain passengers who request a ride through the app in the area. The cars will come from Drive.ai, a Mountain View, California, startup that builds software to turn cars into autonomous vehicles. It is the latest in a string of partnerships between Lyft and an autonomous car company, but it is the one with the most immediate impact to Lyft passengers. There will be initially a small number of cars available, said Drive.ai Co-founder and President Carol Reiley, each with a trained driver in the front seat in case something goes wrong. “We want to make sure the experience feels as much like an autonomous vehicle experience as possible,” Reiley said. Passengers must choose to opt into the program and the rides are free. Reiley declined to disclose the car model being used or precisely when the self-driving Lyft rides would start. Lyft declined to comment further. The program allows Lyft to test how its passengers react to self-driving cars and Drive.ai, a two-year-old company, to log more miles and tweak its software. Reiley said Drive.ai will use its own mapping data for the trips. The program is Lyft’s latest push into autonomous cars since announcing in July a new self-driving car division, including a facility in Palo Alto, California with hundreds of engineers who will work on autonomous technology and collaborate with other autonomous vehicle companies. Lyft has previously announced partnerships with Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) self-driving division, Waymo, technology company Nutonomy, and automakers General Motors Co (GM.N) and Jaguar Land Rover. Lyft has previously said it will launch a pilot with Nutonomy in Boston by year-end. Although Lyft is a late entry into the field of autonomous cars, the partnership gives the company something of a victory over its chief competitor, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]. While Uber was first to offer rides in self-driving cars, using its own autonomous technology, with programs in Pennsylvania and Arizona, it does not yet offer them to passengers in the Bay Area.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber has asked a U.S. judge to exclude evidence from an upcoming trade-secrets trial about how a former engineer downloaded thousands of confidential files from Alphabet Inc’s Waymo self-driving car unit before eventually joining Uber. Uber’s request was contained in a series of court filings late on Wednesday, in which both companies sought to shape how the high-profile trial will proceed next month. The companies are also disputing whether jurors should hear evidence from Alphabet’s chief legal officer David Drummond, and from Bill Gurley, a prominent Silicon Valley investor. Both Drummond and Gurley have previously served on Uber’s board. Waymo claimed in a lawsuit earlier this year that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, which Uber acquired soon after. Uber denies it used any of Waymo’s trade secrets. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on Oct. 10. In a court filing, Uber said it interviewed an Alphabet employee who described the 14,000 files as “low value.” Six of the nine Waymo trade secrets at issue in trial were not contained in the 14,000 files at all, Uber said. Of the remaining three, one is mentioned vaguely, and the other two could easily have been replicated without reference to the downloaded files. In response, Waymo said jurors should be allowed to decide for themselves how important the materials are. “Both Levandowski and Uber recognized the value of the contents within these stolen documents,” they wrote. Beyond the downloads, Uber said it should be allowed to argue that Waymo brought the lawsuit in bad faith to slow down a competitor. As evidence, Uber wants to tell jurors that Drummond failed to fully disclose Waymo’s self-driving car plans while he served on Uber’s board. Waymo said Drummond did nothing improper, and his actions have no relevance to the trade secret claims in the case. For its part, Waymo wants to cite testimony from Bill Gurley, a Benchmark Capital general partner who served on Uber’s board before resigning earlier this year. Benchmark subsequently sued Uber ex-chief executive, Travis Kalanick, seeking to force him off the company’s board, but that case was moved to arbitration.

The companies are also disputing whether jurors should hear evidence from Alphabet’s chief legal officer David Drummond, and from Bill Gurley, a prominent Silicon Valley investor. Both Drummond and Gurley have previously served on Uber’s board. Waymo claimed in a lawsuit earlier this year that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, which Uber acquired soon after. Uber denies it used any of Waymo’s trade secrets. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on Oct. 10. In a court filing, Uber said it interviewed an Alphabet employee who described the 14,000 files as “low value.” Six of the nine Waymo trade secrets at issue in trial were not contained in the 14,000 files at all, Uber said. Of the remaining three, one is mentioned vaguely, and the other two could easily have been replicated without reference to the downloaded files. In response, Waymo said jurors should be allowed to decide for themselves how important the materials are. “Both Levandowski and Uber recognized the value of the contents within these stolen documents,” they wrote. Beyond the downloads, Uber said it should be allowed to argue that Waymo brought the lawsuit in bad faith to slow down a competitor. As evidence, Uber wants to tell jurors that Drummond failed to fully disclose Waymo’s self-driving car plans while he served on Uber’s board. Waymo said Drummond did nothing improper, and his actions have no relevance to the trade secret claims in the case. For its part, Waymo wants to cite testimony from Bill Gurley, a Benchmark Capital general partner who served on Uber’s board before resigning earlier this year. Benchmark subsequently sued Uber ex-chief executive, Travis Kalanick, seeking to force him off the company’s board, but that case was moved to arbitration. Gurley testified in a deposition that he would not have approved acquiring Levandowski’s company had he known the facts of Levandowski’s downloads. Uber said Gurley’s testimony is too speculative to allow into evidence.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - General Motors Co’s self-driving unit, Cruise Automation, is working to open an internal ride-hailing service to people outside the company, aiming to join a small group of autonomous vehicle developers testing their technology with the public. The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Lansing, Michigan October 26, 2015. REUTERS/Rebecca CookCruise’s plan for public tests of its cars is at an early stage. Spokesman Milin Mehta declined to discuss a timeline and said regulatory approval would be needed. Cruise declined to comment further on future business plans. The Cruise Anywhere internal ride service uses GM software and currently is limited to San Francisco employees. Alphabet Inc’s self-driving car unit Waymo in May announced plans to test with ride services company Lyft, and Alphabet is now considering an investment in Lyft. GM already has a stake in Lyft and has been planning to test its autonomous cars in the Lyft network. Mehta declined to comment on Lyft. Testing a ride service underscores GM’s ambitions to adapt its business in the face of a potential shift in the car industry from individual ownership to transportation as a service. Cruise’s expanded ride-hailing test to people outside the company would still have human drivers behind the steering wheel to take over as needed, a staple of real-world tests. Expanding the service also requires adding to Cruise’s fleet of autonomous Chevrolet Bolts. Only a few companies are giving self-driving car rides to the public, including Alphabet, Uber Technologies and startup nuTonomy. Urban environments in climates with variable weather present the most difficulty for self-driving cars, which must learn how to navigate traffic jams and “see” in snow and rain. Developers also are testing passengers’ response to a car without a person behind the wheel. Testing a self-driving ride service means that GM is exploring most parts of transportation as a service, including producing cars and self-driving technology, offering car sharing through its Maven service and now trying ride-sharing. Maven already has begun to use its own Gig leasing business to serve drivers for Lyft, Uber and delivery services. Through Gig, Maven can provide GM vehicles directly to drivers who previously leased from Maven through Lyft Express Drive and Uber Vehicle Solutions. Asked last month if GM through Maven aims to create its own ride and delivery service, Maven boss Julia Steyn said, “We are building this out step by step.” (The story corrects to delete reference to other possible cities) Reporting by Peter Henderson; Editing by Leslie AdlerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chairman Mark Zuckerberg abandoned plans on Friday to create a new class of company stock with no voting power, which was meant to be a way for Zuckerberg to retain control over the company he founded while fulfilling a pledge to give away his wealth. FILE PHOTO: The Facebook application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/File PhotoZuckerberg on Friday said that he could meet the charity pledge and maintain voting control of Facebook without the change. His decision followed a shareholder lawsuit opposed to the creation of a new class of stock. Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook that the company’s stock had performed well enough that he could fund his philanthropy by selling stock for at least 20 years and still retain voting control of the company. In December 2015 Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician, pledged to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares to charity. According to court records, Zuckerberg owns more than 400 million shares of Facebook. That would value his holdings at a minimum of $68.2 billion, based on the company’s closing share on Friday of $170.54. Zuckerberg said he wanted to help solve global challenges “like curing all diseases in our children’s lifetime and personalizing education for every student.” Zuckerberg said that over about the next 18 months he planned to sell 35 million to 75 million shares of Facebook, which at Friday’s closing price would raise $13 billion. The decision came as Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify on Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware, in a shareholder lawsuit seeking to halt the Class C stock plan, which had been approved by shareholders. Sjunde AP-Fonden, a Swedish national pension fund, and The Amalgamated Bank sued last year, saying that Zuckerberg should have to pay for the right to retain control while selling stock. “We brought this case challenging a significant change in Facebook corporate governance, and by agreeing to abandon the reclassification we got everything we could have hoped to get,” said Lee Rudy of shareholder law firm Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check. Rudy said the Class C proposal was rejected by 80 percent of minority shareholders in a vote last year. Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of Facebook’s stockholder vote, which helped carry the proposal. Google, now Alphabet Inc, proposed a similar stock reclassification in 2012, and court records show that Facebook’s general counsel suggested Zuckerberg could use it as a model for Facebook. Google settled with shareholders in a deal that included a $522 million dividend, payable under certain conditions. Withdrawing the share plan comes as Facebook faces pressure over advertisements on the social network and the role they may have played in last year’s U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump questioned on Friday the company’s decision to overhaul how it handles paid political ads amid investigations into alleged Russian interference in U.S. elections.

House Science and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican and climate change denier, asked the CEOs of the technology companies to turn over documents by Oct. 10 that detail the involvement of Russian-based or funded entities detected on their platforms, information on ads they purchased, and any communications concerning ads advocating for “so-called green initiatives.” Smith and the Republicans on the committee that oversees U.S. scientific agencies have targeted mainstream climate change scientists, questioning their integrity and calling for eliminating federal funding for climate research. They have also accused environmental groups of colluding with Russians to push for regulations to curb fossil fuel extraction. “The committee is concerned that divisive social media and political messages conveyed through social media have negatively affected certain energy sectors, which can depress research and development in the fossil fuel sector and expanding potential for natural gas,” Smith wrote in letters to the CEOs. The committee, which oversees U.S. scientific agencies, believes such anti-fracking ads reflect “the Russian government’s concern about the impact of fracking ... on the global energy market and potential challenges to profitability” of Russian energy companies, the letter said. The letter says Russia’s meddling in the U.S. energy market has been “well documented in the public domain” and seeks information similar to what Facebook is providing to the U.S. Senate about anti-immigration propaganda and advertising. Both parties in Washington have been stepping up scrutiny of major internet firms, and considering whether to create new disclosure rules for online political ads after Facebook revealed this month that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations is probing whether President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. Trump and officials from the campaign have said there was no collusion. Smith is dismissive of local and national protests that have emerged around the country objecting to the process of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas because of its affect on water quality, as well as the construction of pipelines to transport fracked oil and gas.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo At a hearing in San Francisco federal court, U.S. District Judge William Alsup said he was skeptical Waymo could ultimately prove that Uber’s self-driving car program used Waymo trade secrets. So far, Waymo had not uncovered convincing evidence that Uber copied its technology, he said. “It is not the home run they were expecting to find,” Alsup said. However, Alsup said he would grant Waymo’s request for more time to investigate documents and e-mails that Uber only recently disclosed. The trial had been scheduled to begin next week. The case pits two companies battling to dominate the fast-growing field of self-driving cars. Waymo claimed in a lawsuit earlier this year that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, which Uber acquired soon after. Uber has denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets. In court on Tuesday, Alsup said Waymo had solid evidence against Levandowski. However, Waymo decided to bring separate legal claims against Levandowski in private arbitration, and did not include him as a defendant in the lawsuit before Alsup.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) on Wednesday unveiled the second generation of its Pixel smartphone along with new voice-enabled home speakers, redoubling its commitment to the hardware business as it competes with a surge of devices from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Google’s new products, including a Pixelbook laptop, wireless earbuds and a small GoPro-like camera, showcase Google-developed operating systems and services, notably the voice assistant. That means usage of those devices should stoke the company’s core ad sales business as buyers of the hardware use Google services like search and maps. Speaking at the launch in San Francisco, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said the new products “perfectly demonstrate our strategy of re-imagining hardware from the inside out.” The Pixel 2 smartphone comes in two sizes, with comparable features, including aluminum bodies and no traditional jacks for headphones. Prices for the base model start at $649, while the high-end version starts at $849. The phones will be available Oct. 19. The Pixel phones lack the brand lustre and market share of similarly priced smartphones such as the Apple iPhone or Samsung Electronics Co’s Galaxy S and Galaxy Note smartphones. Still, the original Pixel’s camera and software drew acclaim from reviewers, many of whom expect the line to become a robust competitor at the high end of the Android smartphone market. Pixelbook, priced at $999, is the first laptop powered by Google Assistant and will support Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat, the company said. The keyboard folds behind the screen to turn the 12.3-inch touchscreen into a tablet. It will be available in stores from Oct. 31. Google Home Mini, one of the new speakers, is priced at $49 in the United States and would rival Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) popular Echo Dot. It will be available Oct. 19. The Home Max, with dual woofers for more powerful sound, is priced at $399 and with availability by the end of the year. The Pixel Buds, which are priced at $149, arrive in November. Clips, which is pocket-sized camera with object detection and automatic recording capabilities, “soon” goes on sale for $249, Google said. Videos last only a few seconds and do not contain audio. The Pixel smartphone debuted a year ago, with analysts estimating sales of more than 2 million, pushing Google to record amounts of non-advertising revenue. Google’s “other” revenue category, which includes both hardware and sales of online storage services, accounted for about 12 percent of overall sales in its most recent quarter. Mario Queiroz, Vice President of Product Management at Google, speaks about the Pixel 2 phone during a launch event in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen LamLast month, Google expanded its hardware development capabilities by picking up a 2,000-person smartphone engineering team at HTC (2498.TW) for $1.1 billion. “It’s pretty clear Google is serious about hardware,” said Avi Greengart, research director at consumer data firm GlobalData. “Given that there is a Pixel 2, and given the financial investment, there must be a longer-term strategic intent.” HARDWARE CHIEF HAS SECOND GO Google moved into smartphones five years ago with the $12.5-billion purchase of Motorola Mobility. But Motorola’s hardware team, under Osterloh, and Google’s Android mobile operating system division remained independent. Google wanted to avoid giving it a special advantage and protect its relationships with Samsung, LG and other distributors of Android. The company later sold the Motorola smartphone business. Osterloh, now working inside Google, moved to bring in-house the HTC team Google contracted to design the Pixel. He enjoys a strong relationship with Hiroshi Lockheimer, the Android division head. The pair have been friends since working together for several years at Good Technology in the early 2000s. Protecting relationships with others in the Android ecosystem has become less of a concern. Samsung ratched down the rivalary with Google after the firms agreed to a major patent licensing deal in early 2014. Other vendors have seen their market share dip. Google’s eye is now on Apple, whose iPhone has become the smartphone to beat. The first Pixel debuted a year ago with a significant marketing push: during the last three months of the year, Google spent an estimated $110 million to air 12 Pixel-related commercials, according to data from advertising measurement firm iSpot.tv. Apple spent $147 million during the same span, iSpot.tv said. Apple has sustained its TV time throughout the last year, while Google’s efforts have tapered off. In the speakers market, Google’s personal-assistant lags Amazon’s Echo devices in market share, according to investment bank Cowen & Co. Last week, Amazon released several new models of the Echo, including one with a display as it tried to find a place in every niche. Slideshow (10 Images)Rishi Chandra, vice president of product management for Google’s Home hardware unit, said in an interview that Google was being “a little bit more thoughtful” than the online shopping company. “Amazon is taking a broad approach,” Chandra said. “We’re going to iterate until we have a good product story to tell.” Reporting by Paresh Dave in San Francisco and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Andrew HayOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"A sign marks a Fidelity Investments office in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. September 21, 2016. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments is testing virtual reality technology to train customer service representatives in its call centers across the United States. The company’s innovation unit Fidelity Labs said in a blog post on Friday that it had developed and tested a virtual reality prototype to train employees on how to handle incoming customer calls. By using virtual reality, the company hopes to make it easier for employees to empathize with customers, Adam Schouela, vice president at Fidelity Labs, said in an interview. While virtual reality has been used for decades for training programs in other sectors, Fidelity said it is the first company in financial services to use the technology for that purpose. Large technology companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook are investing in virtual reality, making the technology more easily accessible by consumers and developers. The Fidelity prototype, which was built on the Google VR headset, simulates a scenario in which the customer representative is at a desk in the company’s call center in New Hampshire. The representative is prompted to handle a call from a distressed client who needs to withdraw money from her account. During the call the client is shown in her kitchen surrounded by bills. The technology’s ability to immerse the user into a realistic scenario, makes it well suited for “empathy training”, said Schouela. The results of the tests will be assessed to determine whether to proceed with the project, Schouela said.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff (R) smile as they look at city models built by children before a press conference where Alphabet Inc, the owner of Google, announced the project "Sidewalk Toronto", that will develop an area of Toronto's waterfront using new technologies to develop high-tech urban areas in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 17, 2017. REUTERS/Mark BlinchAlphabet’s Sidewalk Labs unit, which is developing new technologies for use in “smart cities,” said it would invest $50 million in the initial planning and testing phase of the project, which will create a new neighborhood called Quayside. “For the foreseeable future this will be the primary focus of what we do,” Dan Doctoroff, the chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, said in an interview. One of the first projects Sidewalk Labs will take on is a sensor-based technology to manage crowds on a nearby street often filled with a potent mix of pedestrians, cyclists and motorized traffic, which Doctoroff said could be tested as early as the first quarter of 2018. He said the company was also looking to integrate self-driving technology into the project over the longer term. Assuming initial success, Sidewalk Labs could expand its partnership with Waterfront Toronto, the public agency funded by federal, provincial and city governments with a mandate to develop a much larger area nearby of industrial wasteland. Doctoroff said the company had looked at more than 50 metropolitan areas in North America and sites in western Europe and Australia before settling on Toronto as the prime location for its future city test bed. Google said it would move its Canadian headquarters and some 300 employees to the district once it is completed. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced the partnership with Google, said he hoped that Quayside would become “a thriving hub for innovation and a community for tens of thousands of people to live, work and play.” It is Sidewalk Labs’ most ambitious project to date, which the company expects will house 5,000 people and host another 5,000 workers within three to four years. The Google unit has previously worked with Qualcomm Inc and Civiq Smartscapes to retrofit New York City phone booths into digital billboards that serve as WiFi hotspots. Intersection, the Sidewalk Labs subsidiary behind the effort, recently launched similar kiosks in London. Another division, Flow, has held talks with cities such as Columbus, Ohio, about providing software to evaluate transit programs. Doctoroff said he expects the project to lower the cost of living, including by reducing commutes, and for it to be the world’s first urban development to reduce a city’s carbon footprint.

"Oct 17 (Reuters) - Alphabet’s Google Inc said on Tuesday that it would roll out an advanced protection program in order to provide stronger security for some users such as government officials and journalists who are at a higher risk of being targeted by hackers. The internet giant said that users of the program would have their account security continuously updated to deal with emerging threats. The company said it would initially provide three defenses against security threats, which include blocking fraudulent account access and protection against phishing. The program would include additional reviews and requests in the account recovery process to prevent fraudulent access by hackers who try to gain access by pretending they have been locked out. The rollout of a suite of new email security services by Google follows a U.S. presidential election last year that was shaped in part by the disclosure of emails by anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks belonging to associates of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton that were obtained through phishing schemes. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that those hacks, which included a breach of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s personal Gmail account, were carried out by Russia as part of a broader cyber campaign to help President Donald Trump, a Republican, win the White House. “If John Podesta had Advanced Protection last year, the world might be a very different place,” said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, who was briefed on the new features by Google. Hall said the new features would grow the amount of high-risk consumers with strong protections against phishing campaigns, but that they would potentially create compatibility issues among some who already integrate custom security tools with their Gmail account.

"(Reuters) - Lyft Inc has raised $1 billion in fresh financing, the ride-services company said on Thursday, in a round led by one of Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) investment funds, further complicating the convoluted world of ride-hailing alliances and dealing a blow to rival Uber Technologies Inc. The round was led by CapitalG, the growth investment fund of Alphabet that has also backed large private tech companies such as home-renting platform Airbnb and payments firm Stripe. Six months ago, Lyft raised $600 million from a conglomeration of investors. Lyft said the latest round boosts its valuation to $11 billion from $7.5 billion. CapitalG partner David Lawee will join the company's board, Lyft said, bringing it to a total of 10 directors. (lft.to/2zB1NCw) “Ridesharing is still in its early days and we look forward to seeing Lyft continue its impressive growth,” Lawee said in a statement. Lyft, which runs a distant second to Uber [UBER.UL], has pushed expansion this year. The company says it is available across 41 states and completes more than a million rides a day Lyft is deepening ties to Alphabet despite its partnership with General Motors Co (GM.N), which has invested $500 million. GM president Dan Ammann told Reuters this week that any further plans to collaborate with Lyft were “not defined at this time.” Lyft and Alphabet already have a relationship through a partnership Lyft struck with Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car unit, in May. The two companies are collaborating on bringing autonomous vehicle technology to market, but have not provided many details. Spokespeople for Lyft and Alphabet have said the latest investment will not have any bearing on the Waymo partnership. Alphabet also has ties to Uber through its second investment arm, GV. GV invested in Uber in 2013, but then Uber began to develop autonomous cars and compete directly with Alphabet. Last year, Alphabet executive David Drummond stepped down from the Uber board. This year Waymo sued Uber, alleging trade secret theft, in a case that is set to go to trial in December. “It is another punch by Alphabet at Uber,” said Erik Gordon, an entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. GV could have the opportunity to sell at least some of its stake in Uber in a highly anticipated deal between Uber and SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), which may be finalized in the next week. SoftBank wants to buy between $7 billion and $10 billion in shares from Uber employees and investors. Uber has also been embroiled in sexual harassment claims, lawsuits and U.S. Department of Justice investigations over its business practices. Bill Maris, founder of GV who has since left to run his own venture capital firm, told Reuters last week there is a strong case for GV to sell. “It is completely rational to me as an investor to take all of the money off the table now given all of the drama, all of the toxicity, all of the DOJ investigations,” he said. But Maris and other Uber investors are conflicted, saying the company still has the potential to be worth $100 billion or more. “This thing likely goes up from here,” Maris said.

"(Reuters) - Experimental communications balloons provided by Alphabet Inc in collaboration with AT&T Inc will allow some of the carrier’s customers in storm-ravaged Puerto Rico to send texts and access critical information on the internet, Alphabet said on Friday. Undated handout photo of a Project Loon balloon to be used in Puerto Rico, being launched from Nevada. REUTERS/Google/HandoutAlphabet said the “Project Loon” balloon project would deliver limited internet connectivity to LTE enabled phones in the hardest-hit areas of Puerto Rico. The island’s wireless and broadband communications networks were devastated after Hurricane Maria made landfall last month. This month, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved Alphabet’s application to provide emergency cellular service to Puerto Rico using up to 30 balloons. The company said Friday it does not expect to use that many since each balloon can provide internet service to an area of roughly 5,000 square kilometers, or 1,930 square miles. Puerto Rico’s area is 3,515 square miles. The company has a handful of balloons in the area and more are on the way, spokeswoman Libby Leahy said. Since Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled to regain communications services. As of Friday, 68 percent of cell sites remained out of service, the FCC said. Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solar-powered, high-altitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to support carriers as they restored “limited communications capability” in Puerto Rico. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said this month he was forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force focused on communications problems in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Alphabet said this was “the first time we have used our new machine learning powered algorithms to keep balloons clustered over Puerto Rico, so we’re still learning how best to do this. As we get more familiar with the constantly shifting winds in this region, we hope to keep the balloons over areas where connectivity is needed for as long as possible.” Alphabet said it will continue the project as long as it can usefully do so. “Project Loon is still an experimental technology and we’re not quite sure how well it will work.” In 2016, Project Loon delivered service to tens of thousands of people in flood-damaged parts of Peru in partnership with the Peruvian government and Telefonica. Alphabet, which launched the balloons in Nevada, said Project Loon is already providing service in Puerto Rico.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) self-driving car unit Waymo is expanding winter testing as it works to address a potential blind spot for autonomous vehicles: snowy and icy conditions. Waymo unveils a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Waymo said Thursday that Michigan is the sixth state where the self-driving car project will test autonomous vehicles. The company chose the state to see how vehicles will respond in snow, sleet, and ice. Waymo has been testing vehicles in Texas, Arizona, Washington State, Nevada and California and starts in Michigan next week on public roads with a backup safety driver sitting in the driver seat if necessary. “For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions affects how well you can see and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars,” said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post. “Our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments.” Waymo said it has conducted cold weather testing since 2012, including some around the Nevada and California border of Lake Tahoe, but the new testing in Metro Detroit may pose tougher challenges navigating snow slicked or icy roads crowded with commuters. Waymo opened a development center in Novi, Michigan in May 2016, working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) to integrate Waymo’s self-driving technology into Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans. The new winter testing is in the back yard of Detroit’s Big Three automakers. U.S. automakers have touted plans to get self-driving cars on the roads. General Motors Co (GM.N) chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday the Detroit automaker is working hard on self-driving cars and expects to deploy cars without backup drivers in “quarters not years.” Waymo has been mapping areas in Metro Detroit and wants to assess how its sensors perform in wet, cold conditions. One hurdle is self-driving car mapping software may have challenges in winter weather. One challenge for Waymo may be human drivers. Many self-driving vehicles from numerous companies have been struck by inattentive or careless drivers in California, according to reports to filed with the state.

The same is true for self-driving cars,” said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post. “Our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments.” Waymo said it has conducted cold weather testing since 2012, including some around the Nevada and California border of Lake Tahoe, but the new testing in Metro Detroit may pose tougher challenges navigating snow slicked or icy roads crowded with commuters. Waymo opened a development center in Novi, Michigan in May 2016, working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) to integrate Waymo’s self-driving technology into Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans. The new winter testing is in the back yard of Detroit’s Big Three automakers. U.S. automakers have touted plans to get self-driving cars on the roads. General Motors Co (GM.N) chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday the Detroit automaker is working hard on self-driving cars and expects to deploy cars without backup drivers in “quarters not years.” Waymo has been mapping areas in Metro Detroit and wants to assess how its sensors perform in wet, cold conditions. One hurdle is self-driving car mapping software may have challenges in winter weather. One challenge for Waymo may be human drivers. Many self-driving vehicles from numerous companies have been struck by inattentive or careless drivers in California, according to reports to filed with the state.

By Paresh Dave and Arjun Panchadar SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected advertising sales and higher operating margins, boosting its shares as investors brushed off concerns about higher costs for acquiring mobile users. The stock was up nearly 3 percent at $1,001.50 after the bell. They have gained 25 percent this year. Third-quarter revenue for Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped 24 percent to $27.8 billion, above the average analysts’ estimate of $27.2 billion. Profit of $6.7 billion, or $9.57 per share, was well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Alphabet, along with much of the tech sector, has enjoyed torrid growth in recent years as advertising moves from traditional media to the internet and consumers flock to an ever-expanding array of digital devices. While Google faces political pressure, especially in Europe, over its growing dominance and its role in spreading propaganda online, those problems have yet to hit the bottom line. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts that efforts to attract “both large and small advertisers” around the world were paying off, especially in Asia, where sales rose 29 percent to $4.2 billion. The third quarter was the 15th in a row in which Alphabet has shown double-digit, year-over-year consolidated sales increases. The pace is not slowing down, with the growth rate reaching its highest level in nearly five years. Ad sales at Google, Alphabet’s main operating unit, account for the vast majority of the company’s revenue. The ad business faces competition from Facebook Inc but has continued to grow as more users turn to Google’s YouTube and mobile search services. Alphabet shares trade for almost 25.8 times expected earnings and Facebook at about 26.5 times, according to Thomson Reuters data. Investors have been increasingly concerned about a sharp rise in costs for getting ads in front of users as Google pays Apple Inc and other companies to integrate Google search into mobile products and services. The payments are included in traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, and they rose 54 percent in the quarter, accounting for 12 percent of ad sales. Pichai defended the partnerships in response to several analysts’ questions on Thursday, calling the deals “a win-win construct” because Google performs “better when our partners do well.” “We’re pretty comfortable with how we’re approaching it,” he said. Other analysts said revenue growth and cost controls made TAC increases less of an issue. “There is way too much focus on TAC as a cost - it’s a great investment for Google to control the publishing ecosystem,” said Richard Kramer of Arete Research. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, said: “TAC is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one.” The third-quarter profit margin of 24 percent marked Alphabet’s highest since 27 percent in first quarter of 2013. Google’s other revenue, which includes hardware such as the Pixel smartphones and Home speakers as well as the cloud computing business, also enjoyed solid growth. Sales from non-ad businesses rose 40 percent from a year ago to $3.4 billion in the quarter. Among Google’s top priorities is expanding its salesforce to catch up with Amazon Web Services in providing corporate computing via large data centers, Pichai said. Alphabet does not break out cloud revenue, but Jefferies analysts estimate it at about 15 percent of Google’s other revenue. Google also is trying to take on Apple in the high-end smartphone business with the Pixel. The company deepened its investment in September, agreeing to acquire 2,000 engineers from smartphone maker HTC Corp for $1.1 billion. Google’s Android operating system already powers most non-Apple smartphones. But Google’s second-generation Pixel had a rough debut last week, with users complaining of a faulty screen and clicking noises during calls. The company responded on Thursday by doubling the warranty period for the smartphones to two years and promising to issue software fixes. Losses from Alphabet’s Other Bets segment, which includes the Google Fiber broadband service and smart thermostat maker Nest, narrowed to $812 million from $861 million. The change reflected both an increase in sales across the companies and scaled back expansion plans for Fiber.

The company recorded in the second quarter a $2.7 billion European Commission fine for unfair treatment of shopping websites in search results. Antitrust experts have said another fine could come by the end of year, as the EC investigates its distribution deals with smartphone vendors and wireless carriers.

"Oct 27 (Reuters) - How much bigger can the world’s biggest tech companies get? Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Intel together generated more than $100 billion in revenue in the September quarter, roughly 2 percent of United States’ national output. Judging by premarket gains, the tech giants could add another $75 billion to their combined market value, and spark a broader rally when the market opens on Friday. The companies beat Wall Street expectations for profit and revenue for the quarter, riding on bumper demand for their cloud computing businesses as corporate computing shifts away from company-owned data centers and to the cloud. “Obviously we are headed for a strong opening due to the smashing results from the tech heavyweights,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “I expect markets to close the week on new record highs and a good portion of that should be attributed to the results that came from the tech companies.” Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their price targets on the stocks. Credit Suisse raised its price target on Amazon.com Inc to $1,385 from $1,350, indicating that the stock has room to climb another 42 percent over the next 12 months from Thursday’s close. The brokerage also made the most bullish moves on Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp. Deutsche Bank, the most bullish brokerage on Alphabet, said the company can add another 24 percent to its shares in the next 12 months. While the market is used to record-breaking results from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp’s revenue rose the most in percentage terms in three years, underscoring the success of Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s turnaround strategy. Even old guard Intel Corp, which has been struggling with tepid growth, said revenue from its higher-margin data center business rose 7 percent, slightly beating expectations.

"(Reuters) - U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc (AN.N) announced a multi-year partnership on Thursday to support Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Waymo self-driving car unit, including vehicle maintenance and repairs as the company adds new brands into its fleet, sending its shares up 13 percent to a high for the year. That news was accompanied by a better-than expected third-quarter profit as AutoNation performed well despite the impact of hurricanes during the quarter. There is fierce competition between large automakers to bring self-driving cars to market first. The pact between Waymo and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation is the latest in a series of recent partnerships the self-driving unit has formed. Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020, in vehicle fleets rather than owned by individuals until the price of the technology involved becomes more affordable for consumers. General Motors Co (GM.N) and rival Ford Motor Co (F.N) have both said they aim to sell fully self-driving cars by 2021. AutoNation said its stores will maintain and repair Waymo’s self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid vehicle fleet, plus additional brands as Waymo expands. “The ambition is to grow with Waymo,” AutoNation Chief Executive Mike Jackson told Reuters. “The only way to get a return on a truly autonomous system is on a shared vehicle, where there is an extended life cycle.” That requires service through the manufacturer’s warranty period and beyond, Jackson said. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) is part of an alliance with Waymo to develop self-driving cars based on a test fleet of Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans in Phoenix, Arizona. In June, Waymo signed a multi-year agreement with Avis Budget Group Inc (CAR.O) for the car rental firm to manage its growing autonomous vehicle fleet. Jackson said he was open to acquisitions, but not necessarily of new car dealerships. “We are focused on building our USA” used-vehicle stores, he said. “We are expanding our collision business.” Profit in the quarter was better than expected, as the impact of recent storms wasn’t as bad as feared. The company said Hurricane Irma negatively impacted its aftertax earnings by 8 cents per share. Net income from continuing operations fell to $97.6 million or $1.00 per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $107.8 million or $1.05 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue fell 2.4 percent to $5.43 billion. Analysts on average had expected third-quarter profit of 84 cents per share on revenue of $5.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In morning trading, AutoNation shares were up 13 percent at $53.81.

Some of the ads criticized candidates, while others sought to organize or promote simultaneous rallies for opposite sides of divisive issues. The sample posted on a House committee website pulled from the roughly 3,000 ads Facebook provided to congressional investigators last month. Tech companies recently acknowledged that Russia-based content on U.S. politics and social issues like gun rights, immigration, religion and race had spread on their platforms before and after the election. Some of the ads sampled specifically dealt with the U.S. election and were critical of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. One from an account called “Army of Jesus” said Clinton was supported by evil forces. “Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is,” the post read. It added that Republican candidate Donald Trump was “an honest man” who “cares deeply for this country.” Other ads appeared to be aimed at setting up clashes over hot-button issues. One ad from a group calling itself “Heart of Texas” promoted a rally in Houston on May 21, 2016 to “Stop Islamization” in the U.S. state. Another ad from a separate Facebook page promoted a pro-Islam rally at the same time and venue. The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the 2016 election, in which U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Clinton. The ads were released at a U.S. House Intelligence Committee hearing, where lawyers from Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google testified about Russian influence on their networks. It was the second straight day the companies attempted to ward off criticism from lawmakers that they were slow to respond to Russian abuse. Facebook, the world’s largest social media network, again came under the most scrutiny from lawmakers, who expressed frustration with the company because of its role in targeted marketing. Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch told the committee that 16 million Americans may have been exposed to Russian information on Facebook’s picture-sharing service Instagram beginning in October 2016. The election was on Nov. 8. An additional four million may have seen such material on Instagram before October, though that data was less complete, Stretch said. Examples of Facebook pages are seen, as executives appear before the House Intelligence Committee to answer questions related to Russian use of social media to influence U.S. elections, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 1, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein‘YOU FAILED’ The Instagram figures were in addition to the 126 million Americans who may have seen Russian-backed political content on Facebook over a two-year period, a number the company disclosed earlier this week. The companies’ visit to Washington this week reflected shifting political fortunes for the U.S. tech industry, which after decades of relatively little regulatory scrutiny is now on the defensive on a range of policy issues. “In the past election, you failed,” said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who normally is considered a strong ally of Silicon Valley. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign, including through social media, to try to influence the vote in favor of Trump. A U.S. Justice Department special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating Russian meddling and any potential collusion by Trump’s campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion with Moscow ahead of the election. Democrats and Republicans both said in Wednesday’s Senate intelligence hearing that the tech companies need to do more to police against foreign government abuse on their platforms. Some Republicans, however, sought to distance that scrutiny from questions about the legitimacy of Trump’s election victory. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the panel, said it was impossible to measure the impact or know the motivation of the Russian operation to spread political material on social media. Any conclusions that Trump benefited from Russia, perhaps in a decisive way, to win the White House ignored the complexity of the issue, Burr said. “I’m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily,” he said. ‘UNDERESTIMATING’ THE PROBLEM Some Republicans also sought to portray the amount of Russian content as miniscule compared to the total amount of political material online. The campaigns of Trump and Clinton spent a combined $81 million on Facebook ads, Stretch said, compared to about $46,000 in ad buys from the Internet Research Agency, a suspected Russian troll farm. Slideshow (15 Images)Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said he was disappointed the companies appeared be confining reviews to information linked to the Internet Research Agency, and suggested there could have been far more undetected Russian content. Some senators criticized the companies for sending lawyers, not chief executives, to testify. “If we go through this exercise again, we would appreciate seeing the top people who are making the decision,” said Senator Angus King, an independent.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo will launch a ride-hailing service with no human behind the steering wheel and has been testing the fully self-driving cars on public roads in Arizona, Chief Executive John Krafcik said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: Waymo unveils a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The test without a human in the driver’s seat is a first in the United States as large tech companies, big automakers and well-funded startups race to develop fully autonomous cars. While self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver’s seat ready to take over if the technology fails. Waymo said members of the public will begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans without human drivers in a test run of the service in the next few months in certain areas of Phoenix, Arizona, which has dry, predictable weather. Developers are still grappling with vehicle performance in snow or heavy rain. Members of the public taking part in the company’s trial in Phoenix will be its first customers, using a ride-hailing app. At first, those passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually they will travel alone, although they will be able to hit a button to stop the car. It will roll out the service to the wider public at a later date, although it did not say when. The service will be free at first, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides, a potential way to earn revenue to help offset the steep costs involved in developing the technology. The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars, unlike California and some other states. “Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks after announcing the launch in Lisbon. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately comment on Tuesday but said in September last year that conventionally designed vehicles that can be operated autonomously faced no specific federal legal barrier. With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan. Last week, U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multiyear partnership for vehicle maintenance and repairs for Waymo’s self-driving car operations. General Motors Co, which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year, has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo will launch a ride-hailing service with no human behind the steering wheel and has been testing the fully self-driving cars on public roads in Arizona, Chief Executive John Krafcik said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: Waymo unveils a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The test without a human in the driver’s seat is a first in the United States as large tech companies, big automakers and well-funded startups race to develop fully autonomous cars. While self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver’s seat ready to take over if the technology fails. Waymo said members of the public will begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans without human drivers in a test run of the service in the next few months in certain areas of Phoenix, Arizona, which has dry, predictable weather. Developers are still grappling with vehicle performance in snow or heavy rain. Members of the public taking part in the company’s trial in Phoenix will be its first customers, using a ride-hailing app. At first, those passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually they will travel alone, although they will be able to hit a button to stop the car. It will roll out the service to the wider public at a later date, although it did not say when. The service will be free at first, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides, a potential way to earn revenue to help offset the steep costs involved in developing the technology. The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars, unlike California and some other states. “Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks after announcing the launch in Lisbon. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately comment on Tuesday but said in September last year that conventionally designed vehicles that can be operated autonomously faced no specific federal legal barrier. With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan. Last week, U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multiyear partnership for vehicle maintenance and repairs for Waymo’s self-driving car operations. General Motors Co, which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year, has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Missouri’s attorney general said Monday his office would investigate whether Alphabet Inc’s Google violated the state’s consumer protection and antitrust laws. FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Josh Hawley, a Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill in next year’s elections, announced at a press conference that he issued an investigative subpoena to Google. He expressed concern over the accuracy of the company’s privacy policy, allegations it misappropriated content from rivals and claims it demoted competitors’ websites in search results. Google said it had not yet received the subpoena. “However, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment,” spokesperson Andrea Faville said in a statement. Google has come under growing scrutiny globally as it has become a top provider of online search, mobile software and advertising technology. But formal investigations have reached varying results in the last seven years. Attorney generals of 37 states reached a $7 million settlement in 2013 over Google’s unauthorized collection of Wi-Fi data through its Street View digital-mapping cars. A Federal Trade Commission inquiry also prompted Google that year to agree to provide advertisers and patent licensees more flexible terms. The FTC, though, did not bring the stronger antitrust charges that Google rivals such as Microsoft Corp and Yelp Inc sought. States including Ohio, Mississippi and Texas saw inquiries falter without substantive consequences. Missouri’s Hawley said the FTC’s inaction created an opening. “We are going to act to hold corporate giants accountable ... for the good of the people of Missouri,” Hawley said. Asked at the press conference whether his senate candidacy played a role in opening the Google inquiry, Hawley said he acted upon his oath of office and desire “to get to the truth.” He pointed to the European Union fining Google $2.7 billion in June for unfairly favoring links to its own shopping service over those from other e-commerce websites. Hawley said he was moved to act because of concern that Google is engaging in similar behavior domestically. Google is appealing the EU fine. The other issue cited by Hawley may be tied to complaints from Yelp. The business reviews’ website wrote the FTC and the attorney generals of all 50 states in September that Google has copied images from its service without permission in violation of a commitment made to the U.S. antitrust regulator.

"(Adds dropped word in 6th paragraph and fixes typo in paragraph 16) By Heather Somerville and Dan Levine SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc withheld evidence in a lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc’s Waymo, a U.S. judge said on Tuesday, delaying a trial to give Waymo time to review a letter alleging Uber trained employees to steal trade secrets and hide their tracks. The multibillion-dollar case, in which Waymo has accused Uber of stealing confidential information about its self-driving car designs, has hobbled Uber’s autonomous vehicle ambitions and is the highest-stakes legal challenge on a lengthy list of litigation that new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi inherited when joining the company in August. The hearing on Tuesday centered on a 37-page letter from a lawyer for former Uber security analyst Richard Jacobs, which Uber did not show Waymo as both sides prepared their cases. The letter turned up last week when it was provided suddenly to U.S. District Judge William Alsup by the U.S. Department of Justice, days before the trial was set to begin. That Uber had not turned over the letter months ago when it was asked to gather such documents raised the judge’s ire, setting up one of the most heated hearings in the case to date. “I can’t trust anything you say because it’s been proven wrong so many times,” he told Uber at the hearing. “You’re just making the impression that this is a total cover-up.” Alsup agreed to Waymo’s request to delay the jury trial scheduled for next week, saying in San Francisco federal court that “if even half of what this letter says is true it would be a huge injustice to force Waymo to go to trial” as planned. It was the second time the judge has agreed to delay a trial at Waymo’s request. In October, he chided Uber lawyers for disclosing thousands of emails to Waymo just before the trial had been set to begin.. Jacobs, who was fired from his job at Uber in April but still works for the company as a consultant, testified on Tuesday about the contents of the letter. The letter said an organization within Uber called marketplace analytics “exists expressly for the purpose for acquiring trade secrets, code base and competitive intelligence.” In his testimony, Jacobs described an elaborate intelligence operation inside Uber to deliberately research competitors and gather data about them, and use technology to avoid a paper trail. “I did not believe it was patently legal,” Jacobs said. “I had questions about the ethics of it.” Uber employees involved in researching rivals were given training with the purpose to “impede, obstruct or influence any lawsuit against Uber,” Jacobs said, including a communication strategy to ensure Uber did not create a paper trail that could come back to haunt the company in any “anticipated litigation.” The strategy included using ephemeral messaging apps such as Wickr and laptops and wireless internet devices that could not be traced back to the user, Jacobs said. Uber employees also used separate servers from the rest of the business, he said, and invented attorney-client privileges to keep communications secret. Uber also relied on as many as 10 outside security vendors. Jacobs said he learned of this activity primarily through discussions at Uber involving his manager and other colleagues. Jacobs, however, disagreed with a portion of the letter his attorney had written on his behalf that asserted a team of Uber employees stole trade secrets from Waymo. “None of the testimony today changes the merits of the case. Jacobs himself said on the stand today that he was not aware of any Waymo trade secrets being stolen,” an Uber spokeswoman said. Former Uber security analyst Ed Russo testified Tuesday and rebuffed Jacobs’ claims that he was a key figure in Uber’s effort to recruit insiders at competitors to steal confidential information, and instruct Uber staff to keep their communications covert. “It’s never been our role or my role to engage in the theft of trade secrets,” Russo said. “That’s false.” Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after. Uber has denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets. Levandowski has declined to answer questions about the allegations, citing constitutional protections against self-incrimination, and Uber has since fired him. Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion and wants to curtail Uber’s self-driving car program, which Waymo says uses its technology. Uber rejects the financial damages claim. A new date for the trial has not yet been set, but the hearing will resume Wednesday with testimony from Uber’s in-house lawyer, Angela Padilla. Jacobs last May sent to Padilla a letter outlining his concerns about Uber’s behavior very similar to the letter obtained from the Justice Department. Waymo has accused Uber of concealing Jacobs’ letter with Padilla. Jacobs said that he believed Uber fired him because he objected to its practices. After his termination, he and Uber reached a $4.5 million settlement. He has been paid $2 million and will receive another $1 million at the end of his consulting contract, he said. He received another $1.5 million in Uber stock. Uber attorneys chalked up Jacobs’ letter to an ex-employee seeking money. “There is not one bit of admissible jury evidence from that witness,” said Arturo Gonzalez of Morrison Foerster. The ride-hailing service is the most valuable private U.S. company, but its aggressive expansion has been dogged by scandals. Most recently, Uber revealed last week that the data of 57 million Uber customers and 600,000 drivers had been stolen in a breach more than a year ago, and that the company had paid two hackers $100,000 to cover it up. Governments across the globe have launched investigations into the incident, and the Illinois’ Cook County prosecutor and Washington state attorney general have filed lawsuits against Uber for failing to comply with data breach notification laws.

The government ordered the probe as part of wider media reforms, amid growing concern for the future of journalism and the quality of news following years of declining profits and newsroom job cuts and the rise of fake news. “We will examine whether platforms are exercising market power in commercial dealings to the detriment of consumers, media content creators and advertisers,” Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. The inquiry also would study how Facebook and Google operated to “fully understand their influence in Australia”, he added. A Google spokesman said, “We look forward to engaging with this process as relevant.” Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The idea for an ACCC investigation was hatched during media reform negotiations in parliament earlier this year, which resulted in a relaxation of ownership laws to allow the country’s big players to boost their market share to better compete against online disruptors. Independent media analyst Peter Cox told Reuters it was unclear what measures the competition regulator could recommend to the government even if it found the country’s media sector was increasingly anti-competitive. “You could see this as a stepping stone towards another type of reform, such as tax,” said Cox. Jurisdictions around the world, including the European Union, are grappling with how to tax technology giants with global operations. Currently corporate taxes are paid where firms have a physical presence, which allows digital multinationals to book most of their profits where they have set up headquarters as opposed to where they make their money. The Australian probe will have power to demand information from businesses and hold hearings. It is due to make its final report in 18 months.

Facebook climbed 2.31 percent, while Google parent-company Alphabet added 1.23 percent, helping the S&P 500 end higher after the index lost ground for four straight sessions. “Technology once again is leading the way here,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. The top-performing sector this year, the S&P 500 information technology index had fallen nearly 3 percent since Nov. 28, with some investors cautious about high earnings multiples. Lululemon jumped 6.43 percent after the Canadian apparel maker reported a higher-than-expected profit and gave an upbeat holiday season forecast. General Electric increased about 0.3 percent after the industrial conglomerate said it was cutting 12,000 jobs at its global power business. Strong earnings and expectations of corporate tax cuts promised by President Donald Trump have pushed stocks up to record levels this year. The Senate Republicans on Wednesday agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on the tax bill amid early signs that lawmakers could agree on a final bill ahead of a self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline. Thursday’s stock gains suggested investors were not overly worried about a deadline on Friday night faced by Trump and Congress to pass fresh spending legislation. If they cannot agree on the terms, parts of the federal government could shut down. “Market participants are looking past the government shutdown,” said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. “It’s a risk-on mood through the last trading session. That will continue into the weekend.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.29 percent to end at 24,211.48 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.29 percent to 2,636.98. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.54 percent to 6,812.84. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with industrial and materials indexes leading the gainers. The S&P 500 consumer staples index fell 0.93 percent, hurt by drops of at least 1.2 percent in Procter & Gamble, Pepsico and Coca-Cola. LendingClub plunged 15.53 percent after the online lender lowered its quarterly revenue forecast. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting a rapid tightening of the labor market. The report comes ahead of more comprehensive government payrolls data on Friday that would be used by investors to gauge the strength of the labor market at a time when the Federal Reserve is almost certain to raise U.S. interest rates next week. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.75-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Lyft presents itself as a friendlier version of Uber, which is facing investigations by governments around the world, including in Canada, over its cover up of a massive 2016 data breach. Uber has been criticized for a lax attitude to regulations and accused of trade-secret theft. “This is a monumental day for Lyft,” the company’s Toronto general manager Tim Houghton told a news conference, before Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Marcus Stroman hailed the company’s first Canadian ride to deliver toys to a local hospital. “Passengers want another option and drivers know that Lyft was built on caring for its driver community and want that experience,” he said. Houghton said more than 50,000 people in Toronto, Canada’s largest city, have downloaded the Lyft app this year, but declined to say how many drivers have signed up beyond saying the number was above 100. Uber said it has 32,000 drivers in Toronto who have made at least four trips in the last month. “We’re committed to ensuring that we have the right number of drivers to meet the demand we’re seeing in the market,” Houghton said in an interview. Slideshow (2 Images)He declined to say if the company was planning to launch in other Canadian cities. Lyft will pay Toronto drivers 75-80 percent of the fare passengers pay, comparable to what Uber pays, Houghton said. Uber, which has operated in Canada for five years, said it welcomed competition that would encourage the use of more shared mobility services over having people driving their own cars. Lyft raised $1 billion in October, in a financing round led by CapitalG, the growth investment fund of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and in September hired an initial public offering advisory firm.

"(Reuters) - Andrew Ng, co-founder of some of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O)-owned Google’s most prominent artificial intelligence projects, on Thursday launches a new venture with iPhone assembler Foxconn to bring AI and so-called machine learning onto the factory floor. FILE PHOTO: Employees work inside a Foxconn factory in the township of Longhua in the southern Guangdong province, China, May 26, 2010. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo Consumers now experience AI mostly through image recognition to help categorize digital photographs and speech recognition that helps power digital voice assistants such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) Siri or Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Alexa. But at a press briefing in San Francisco two days before Ng’s Landing.ai venture is introduced, he demonstrated an example of using AI for visual inspection in a factory’s quality control efforts. In many factories, workers look over parts coming off an assembly line for defects. Ng showed a video in which a worker instead put a circuit board beneath a digital camera connected to a computer and the computer identified a defect in the part. Ng said that while typical computer vision systems might require thousands of sample images to become “trained,” Landing.ai’s system would take only five training images, making it easier to adapt to different tasks in a factory. Ng said Landing.ai had been approached by investors but had not accepted outside capital yet. Foxconn, known more formally as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), is Landing.ai’s first strategic partner. Ng said the startup has been working with Foxconn since July, but he would not elaborate on the nature of the collaboration or which of Foxconn’s customers it might involve. Foxconn makes products for many companies aside from Apple. He said he understands that his firm’s technology is likely to displace factory workers but that Landing.ai is already working on how to train workers for higher-skilled, higher paying factory work involving computers. “I would love to help displaced workers gain the skills they need to succeed,” Ng told reporters. Ng, a Stanford University professor, co-founded Google Brain in 2011, an effort that strung together thousands of computers that learned to identify objects like cats purely from watching YouTube videos. Researchers considered it an accomplishment because the computers had not be “taught” about cats beforehand, but learned on their own through what researchers call “deep learning.” Ng in 2014 moved to Chinese internet giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) to head up its artificial intelligence research group. He resigned from Baidu in March. Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Grant McCoolOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Jan 4 (Reuters) - Cityblock Health, a healthcare company which aims to serve low-income urban residents covered by Medicaid and Medicare, said on Thursday it received $20.8 million in a first round of funding from Maverick Ventures, Thrive Capital and Sidewalk Labs, the subsidiary of Alphabet Inc that founded Cityblock. Cityblock Health investors also include Dr. Mario Molina, the former chief executive of Molina Healthcare, and a new investment firm formed by Andy Slavitt, the former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama. The new company hopes to improve care by making it easier for low-income patients living in city neighborhoods to get personalized care, including preventive visits, mental health coverage and access to appropriate social service programs. The hope is that these services will improve patient health and avoid unnecessary emergency room visits or a bigger healthcare crisis that requires a hospital admission. Cityblock works with a variety of entities including providers, health plans and community organizations to provide the service at no extra cost to patients. The company hopes to open its first healthcare hub in New York this spring. “Despite the boom in venture-backed and technology-based innovations, people on Medicaid and other low-income urban populations have been largely left behind,” said Cityblock’s CEO and co-founder Iyah Romm. He said he hopes the company can address the problems “by combining a data-driven approach to both operations and clinical delivery.” Medicaid now covers one in five Americans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Since the program expanded as a result of the Affordable Care Act, enrollment climbed to 71.2 million in 2016, up from 54 million in 2010. Republicans in Congress, citing the growing costs of Medicaid, have proposed ways to overhaul the program and reduce spending. Medicaid and Medicare accounted in 2016 for almost 60 percent of revenues of the five largest U.S. commercial health insurers - UnitedHealthcare, Anthem, Aetna, Cigna and Humana — according to a recent Health Affairs study. The combined Medicare and Medicaid revenue from those insurers grew from $92.5 billion in 2010to $213.1 billion in 2016.

FILE PHOTO: Logo of German tyre company Continental is seen before the annual news conference in Hanover, Germany March 2, 2017. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo Germany’s premium automakers BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi (NSUG.DE) bought HERE for 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in 2015 from Finnish telecoms group Nokia NOK1V.HE. They now hold 74 percent. The automakers wanted to avoid becoming dependent on third-party mapping providers such as Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google, a competitor in the race to develop self-driving cars. Chip maker Intel (INTC.O) also holds a 15 percent stake in HERE. Continental and privately owned Bosch said separately they wanted to advance their expertise in driver-assistance and other data-based technologies. AUTONOMOUS WORLD Carmakers are spending billions on developing electric vehicles and software-based mobility services as tougher emission rules, a shift toward shared mobility and connectivity are transforming the auto industry. “Our vision for HERE is to enable an autonomous world for everyone,” said HERE Chief Executive Edzard Overbeek. “To achieve this you need strong partners that complement each other in different areas.” Continental said it would sign a collaboration agreement with Dutch HERE and also seek to jointly develop a high-definition live map for autonomous cars. Software and electronics products are the biggest drivers of growth at Hanover-based Continental which also makes fuel-injection systems and vehicle tyres. It plans to boost total sales to more than 50 billion euros by 2020 from 40.5 billion in 2016. “By leveraging HERE’s technology, we look forward to generating further profitable growth in mobility services and automated driving,” Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said. Continental shares were up 0.7 percent at 231.30 euros at 1308 GMT. A spokesman for Amsterdam-based HERE, which employs 8,000 staff in 54 countries, said it was possible that more investors will buy into the company in which Japanese electronics firm Pioneer 6773.T has a stake of less than one percent. A group of investors led by Chinese mapping firm Navinfo (002405.SZ) and internet giant Tencent (0700.HK) had to abandon a plan in September to buy 10 percent of HERE, after failing to win U.S. approval. Bosch’s statement on Thursday referred to plans by HERE to increase its diversification into non-automotive applications - a move that could help to offset risks surrounding the eventual arrival of fully autonomous cars for the mass market. “Bosch is more than cars,” Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said in the statement. He said the company saw synergies with data-based services for smart homes and smart cities - terms broadly describing the use of technology to find efficiencies everywhere from the factory floor to road traffic management.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google has joined an investment in Chinese live-stream mobile game platform Chushou that brings the startup’s total funding to $120 million, as the U.S. firm eyes new inroads to China where its search engine is blocked. FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Picture Founded in 2015, Chushou is an online e-sports platform where users can live stream their mobile phone games. The service has roughly 8 million streamers and 250,000 live streams a day, said the companies in a statement on Friday. Google will help the Chinese firm expand its services to target more overseas viewers, it said. Live stream gaming platforms are a popular form of e-sports in China, part of a growing industry that involves competitive game play viewed by spectators. Google’s YouTube launched a specialized service for live stream gamers in 2015, capturing a large chunk of the global market. The companies did not reveal the size of Google’s stake or the valuation of Chushou after the round. It is Google’s second investment in a Chinese startup in recent years, as the search engine giant looks for new avenues into the Chinese market where its flagship search engine has been blocked by censorship authorities since 2012. The U.S. firm took a minority stake in Beijing-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup Mobvoi in 2015 as part of a $75 million fundraising round. (reut.rs/2CtlBsy) Google’s inability to access China’s large population of young, tech-savvy internet users poses a challenge for the firm whose search engine has expanded to become the world’s largest and most ubiquitous. Last year the firm began targeting China as a potential market to expand its AI offerings. In December, it launched an artificial intelligence lab in China, and in May it held a Go match between its AI project Alpha Go and Chinese Go champion Ke Jie. The match was highly publicized in international media but was not widely covered in local media. Last month, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai also spoke at a high-profile event in China organized by the Cyberspace Administration of China, which oversees internet censorship in the country. “Chushou has built an impressive platform, with a dedicated and quickly growing base of content creators and consumers, and smart expansion plans,” said Frank Lin, who oversees corporate development for Google in North Asia, in the statement. Google said it joins existing investors Qiming Venture, Shunwei Capital and Alpha X Capital in the latest round.

This comes after Google joined an investment in Chinese live-stream mobile game platform Chushou earlier this month, as the company eyes new inroads to China, where its search engine is blocked. Google’s map service has not been available in China since the company largely pulled its services out of the country in 2010 after refusing to continue self-censoring its search results. Since then, it has maintained a limited presence in the world’s biggest smartphone market.

The U.S. technology company has signed similar agreements before with Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Cisco Systems Inc, but the deal with Tencent is a first with a large Chinese tech firm. Google has previously said that agreements such as these reduce the potential of litigation over patent infringement. The agreement with the Chinese social media and gaming firm Tencent covers a broad range of products and paves the way for collaboration on technology in the future, Google said on Friday, without disclosing any financial terms of the deal. Tencent oversees China’s top social media and payments app, WeChat, which has close to a billion users. It also oversees one of the country’s most popular app stores and hosts the country’s biggest gaming and livestream platforms. Google did not disclose the scope of the new patent deal and Tencent did not immediately respond to questions about which products the patent agreement will cover. “By working together on agreements such as this, tech companies can focus on building better products and services for their users,” said Mike Lee, Google’s head of patents.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Netflix Inc’s (NFLX.O) quarterly results on Monday may offer an advanced preview of whether Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other heavyweights behind much of the U.S. stock market’s record-breaking rally can keep delivering. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., January 8, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidWall Street on Friday shrugged off a looming U.S. government shutdown and propelled the S&P 500 to a record high as investors focused on upcoming quarterly reports. Republicans and Democrats appeared to harden their positions on Sunday as both sides hunkered down for what could be a prolonged fight, with the shutdown in its second day. There appeared to be no clear path for a quick end to the crisis. Many of the largest companies - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com - have outperformed the broader market in the first 13 trading days of 2018, with investors betting strong earnings growth will justify tech valuations at their highest levels in a decade. Netflix, which is due to report its quarterly results on Monday after the stock market closes, has jumped nearly 15 percent this year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 5 percent increase. Netflix’s 53 percent surge in 2017, along with rallies by Amazon.com and Silicon Valley’s largest tech companies, helped propel the stock market to new highs. “Netflix is going to be a great early indicator of risk appetite for these high-volatility growth names,” said Wedbush trader Joel Kulina. “Netflix’s drivers are very company-specific, but if this stock can deliver, there’s no reason this whole market can’t keep going higher.” The Los Gatos, California-based company faces increasing competition from streaming services including Amazon.com’s Prime Video and moves by traditional media companies. But investors remain optimistic about its ability to beat expectations. Its stock recently traded at 95 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, versus AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) at 44 times earnings and Time Warner Inc TWX.N at 14 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. Underscoring investors’ willingness to pay premium prices for fast-growing stocks, Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York, recently helped a client buy $1.5 million worth of shares in Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google parent company Alphabet as investments for his grandchildren. “I said, ‘You’re crazy,’ but he was very direct, he wanted the FAANG stocks,” Blancato said, using a widely used Wall Street acronym for those companies. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 technology companies to deliver a 15.9 percent increase in earnings for the December quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings for the entire S&P 500 are seen rising 12.2 percent, bolstered by lower unemployment and fatter wages. Technology investors during the reporting season just under way are also eager to hear company executives explain how their bottom lines will be affected by corporate tax cuts passed by Congress in December, and whether they plan to repatriate overseas profits. Apple said on Wednesday it would make about $38 billion in one-time tax payments on its overseas cash, and investors want to know how much of the $252 billion held abroad Apple will bring home and potentially spend on dividends, share buybacks or acquisitions. In its third-quarter earnings released on Oct. 16, Netflix reported it had added more global subscribers than analysts expected. In response, its stock hit a record high in after-hours trade before dipping the following day. In October, Netflix hiked U.S. prices for the first time since 2015, potentially providing more cash to produce original content but also increasing the risk of losing customers. Netflix has forecast adding 6.3 million subscribers worldwide in the December quarter, which would bring its global customer base to nearly 115.6 million. Analysts on average expect a 32.5 percent jump in revenue to $3.28 billion, and net income of $186.3 million, up 179 percent. Analysts expect earnings per share of 41 cents. After the market closed on Friday, the U.S. Senate was racing to avert a government shutdown ahead of a midnight deadline on a stopgap spending measure amid lingering disagreements between Democrats and Republicans. Investors have said they are not worried about a major pullback in shares, even if lawmakers fail to strike a deal. Up 42 percent in the past 12 months, the S&P 500 information technology index is trading more than 19 times expected earnings, its highest since 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. Facebook will post quarterly results on Jan. 31, followed by Amazon.com, Apple and Alphabet on Feb 1.

Wall Street on Friday shrugged off the then looming U.S. government shutdown and propelled the benchmark S&P 500 stock index to a record high as investors focused on upcoming quarterly reports. But the U.S. Congress was not able to pass stop-gap spending legislation by the midnight Friday deadline leading to the start of a federal government shutdown of many agencies. U.S. Senate leaders had still not resolved the issue Sunday afternoon. Democrats demanded that President Donald Trump negotiate on immigration issues as part of any agreement to resume government funding and accused him of reneging on an earlier accord to protect “Dreamers,” illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children.

Stephen Gillett, chief executive of Chronicle and a former top official at the cyber firm Symantec Corp, said access to Google’s expertise in automated data analysis would give the company an edge. Alphabet’s big cash pile and existing customer relationships also make Chronicle a threat to security tools vendors such as Symantec, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Cylance Inc. The global cyber security market is worth nearly $100 billion, according to market researcher Gartner. But analysts note that previous efforts by internet search and networking companies to get into the cyber security business have faltered. “Being the heavy hitter and even having small teams spun out of that doesn’t translate to instant success,” said Avivah Litan, a vice president at Gartner. Gillett, on a conference call, declined to specify how Chronicle’s technology works and would not give the exact number of companies testing the service. Chronicle also houses VirusTotal, a virus-scanning tool Google acquired in 2012 that charges for premium features. The cyber security initiative reflects Alphabet’s desire to expand beyond its core online advertising business at Google and become a major player in enterprise computing technology. Google is a distant rival to Amazon.com Inc in cloud computing infrastructure and lags far behind Microsoft Corp in workplace productivity software. Gillett, also a former Starbucks Corp chief information officer, said Chronicle aims to identify problems in seconds or minutes instead of hours or days. The process would be aided by lowering customers’ data storage costs. Keeping years of logs can make the threat-detection process more effective, he said. Gillett co-founded Chronicle in February 2016 with former Google cyber security leaders Shapor Naghibzadeh and Mike Wiacek. Gillett met them after becoming executive-in-residence at GV, Alphabet’s venture capital investment arm, in 2015.

"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc replaced long-time Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt with board veteran John Hennessy, a former Stanford University president and one of search engine company’s first users, it said in a regulatory filing on Thursday. Hennessy, 65, a computer scientist with expertise in chip design and deep connections in Silicon Valley, joined Google’s board in 2004 months before the company went public. He was dean of Stanford’s engineering school when students Sergey Brin and Larry Page developed Google and was an early tester of their technology. Hennessy will be non-executive chairman, unlike Schmidt, who was an Alphabet employee. Shirley Tilghman also announced her retirement from the Alphabet’s board effective Feb. 15, the company said in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Schmidt stepped down in January, ending a 17-year-run in which he played a central role in building a promising startup called Google into a global technology powerhouse. He remains a board member and adviser on technical and science issues. Hennessy’s chairmanship begins at a time when lawmakers, privacy critics and other groups fear that Google may have too much control over how people connect with each other in the digital age. It has been blasted for allowing extremist videos to stream on YouTube and misleading news to lead Google search results. Rivals in Alphabet’s biggest business, online advertising, have complained about anti-competitive practices. Questions about collection of user data are omnipresent, especially as Alphabet develops cars, smart speakers and facial recognition software. Hennessy presided over Stanford as it became more academically competitive with Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Yale universities. He saw its endowment surge during boom years in Silicon Valley, where the school is located. As a Stanford researcher, Hennessy co-founded chip design startup Mips Computer Systems, which was acquired by Silicon Graphics International in 1992. He has been lead independent director at Google and Alphabet since 2007. Schmidt came to Google as a veteran tech executive to provide “adult supervision,” as he, Page and Brin have described it. He served as chairman from 2001 to 2004 and from 2007 through January. Schmidt led the company’s involvement in industry disputes and public policy fights around the world. He oversaw Google’s 2004 initial public offering and its reorganization under the Alphabet holding company in 2015. Over the last two years, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google’s enterprise business, have taken on a greater role as the public faces of the company.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google has struggled for years to get big businesses to embrace G Suite, its hip alternative to Microsoft Office. FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoMicrosoft Corp dominates the $15-billion market for business productivity tools for a reason: Its longstanding product is reliable and IT managers have little incentive to gamble on something new. Still, Google has made inroads by throwing more resources at this lucrative market and finally listening to its business customers. Since Google got serious about developing features for major enterprises two years ago, the number of organizations paying for G Suite has doubled to more than 4 million, a new figure expected to be highlighted in Alphabet’s earnings announcement Thursday. Most of those customers are small and medium-sized companies. But some big names have signed on too. Verizon Communications Inc, Nielsen Holdings Plc and Colgate-Palmolive Co alone have brought about 250,000 workers to G Suite over the past 15 months, according to the companies. Other big firms are now giving it a serious look, said Jeffrey Mann, an analyst at research firm Gartner. “I have been talking to traditionally conservative companies in government, aerospace, financial services” that are considering buying G Suite, Mann said. “That would not have happened two years ago.” G Suite may never be an Office killer. Just 15 companies listed in the S&P 500 currently have Google’s business tools, according to a review of public email server data by Reuters. Its $1.3 billion in G Suite sales ranked a distant No. 2 behind Office’s $13.8 billion, according to 2016 data from Gartner. But Mann and other analysts say that second place is not a bad spot. Smartphones and artificial intelligence have opened up new opportunities for Google to get on the radar of corporate IT departments even if it never tops Microsoft, they said. A robust G Suite is a cornerstone of Google’s efforts to diversify revenue, which overwhelmingly comes from online ad sales. At a minimum, Google is loosening loyalty to Microsoft at a time when the Redmond, Washington-based giant also faces competition from startups such as chat service Slack that offer specialized online business tools. Google’s low-cost, subscription-based G Suite has also pushed Microsoft to adopt a similar strategy with Office 365, an online version of its popular software. Okta Inc, a leading provider of security software, said G Suite usage among its nearly 4,000 customers rose 49 percent year-over-year in the 12 months ended Oct 31, compared to 40 percent growth for Office 365. G Suite’s enterprise focus “is paying off,” Okta said in a report last month. Yet Office 365 remains the most popular service among Okta’s customers, hundreds of which are larger enterprises. Among companies listed on the broader S&P 1500 index, 11.5 percent moved to Office 365 in the last two years, according to an email records review by investment firm Winton Group Ltd. That outpaced G Suite, which saw 6.8 percent of those firms come its way, including technology, industrial, entertainment and retail companies. “They are putting people in place, but there’s still a lot of work for Google to begin growing their business in those larger accounts,” said TJ Keitt, a workplace software analyst at Forrester Research. NEW FOCUS Schools and startups had been Google’s top business suite users since the package debuted in 2006. They liked the low prices and collaborative features such as the ability for multiple users to edit a single document simultaneously. By 2012, Google sought bigger, more profitable clients. But it offered minimal handholding, leading companies to doubt its long-term interest. That changed in 2016 when Google brought in new leaders and rebranded its business apps as G Suite. Non-paying users of Gmail, Docs and other productivity tools still make up the lion’s share of Google clients. But its priorities are clear. About 80 percent of nearly 250 new G Suite features introduced last year, including an automated tool for redacting sensitive data from files, were primarily aimed at paying enterprises, according to Google. Prabhakar Raghavan, a vice president overseeing G Suite, told Reuters that Alphabet’s board decided to “bet big” on the enterprise sales effort and cleared his unit to spend freely. “It’s no longer one employee at a small startup administering us,” Raghavan said. “These are demanding chief information officers. They are not going to come on a website and click a ‘buy’ button.” He said Google engineers meet regularly with corporate executives and rely on business customers to test features. Close interaction with Nielsen, for example, led Google to add corporate templates in Docs and put third-party content embedding into its internal web page builder Sites, the companies said. More recently, Google said it postponed the launch of new search technology for businesses to add complex filtering that large customers requested. “The focus isn’t any longer, ‘We’re Google. We know what’s best for you,’” Mitch Greenwald, managing partner at G Suite sales partner Cloudbakers, said of the new attitude. Still, Raghavan acknowledged the difficulty of getting IT pros to break up with Microsoft. “Undeniably, there is an incumbency, a legacy of organizations growing up using Microsoft” to just stick with it, Raghavan said. “There’s a retraining that needs to go on.” Google can win on price. At $25-per-user monthly for a major enterprise, it is $10-a-head cheaper than Microsoft Office’s top list price. Demographics have helped too. Young adult workers who used Gmail and Google Docs growing up are natural business adopters. Last month Google announced a new paid version of G Suite aimed at the workforces of universities and schools. “There’s people who have gone through their entire college career with G Suite and now have to learn Office,” said Mark Sami, vice president at tech consulting firm SPR, which helps businesses install Microsoft software. If Microsoft is worried, it is not saying. Microsoft spokespeople declined to discuss G Suite’s growth, saying instead that Office continues to attract users. Business sales of Office 365 surged more than 40 percent in each of Microsoft’s last three quarters compared to year-earlier periods, accounting for most of the more than $7 billion in quarterly Office-related revenue. Both Microsoft and Google have sought to allay clients’ privacy concerns, certifying that data remains in customers’ control and will not be used for advertising. “That barrier has been taken away for most organizations,” SPR’s Sami said. Google’s enterprise unit, meanwhile, has gone on a hiring binge, opening its own campus in Sunnyvale, California. It is yet another sign of its commitment to G Suite, analysts said. “To show that there’s more and more features being released, that ups the ante in the pot,” Gartner analyst Craig Roth said. “They are less and less likely to walk away from this.” Reporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by Marla DickersonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Shares of Alphabet dipped more than 5 percent after-hours, before steadying with a 2.7 percent loss at $1,149.93. Though growing demand for pricey ads on mobile apps has kept Google’s core ad business surging, the company has moved aggressively to maintain dominance and diversify sales. Expenses jumped 27 percent to $24.7 billion in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period. Google bought ads during major sports events to market its new Pixel 2 smartphone and YouTube television service. It slashed prices on other hardware in the race to get online search and media streaming devices into people’s homes. Google continued to quickly add staff to its enterprise sales unit. A growing portion of revenue has been spent on having the Google search engine set as the default option on products and services such as Apple Inc’s iPhone and Mozilla’s Firefox browser. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts in a post-earnings conference call that higher marketing costs coincided with holidays and that payments to partners such as Apple and Mozilla would steady in coming quarters. Investments are paying off, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said, noting that cloud computing is generating $1 billion in quarterly sales. He said Google’s G Suite workplace software package had doubled its customers to 4 million in two years, as Reuters first reported earlier on Thursday. Financial analysts looked past the spending. “Overall, it was a good quarter. Advertising revenue is still up significantly,” Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said in an email. Fourth-quarter sales increased 24 percent to $32.3 billion, above the average analysts’ estimate of $31.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted quarterly profit of $6.8 billion, or $9.70 per share, missed estimates of $7 billion, or $10 per share. Related CoverageAlphabet shares fall as rising costs, margin pressure roil investorsThe profit figure excludes a $9.9 billion tax charge as Alphabet joined much of corporate America in reporting large one-time expenses in the fourth quarter due to U.S. legislation enacted in December that lowers corporate rates. The tax law has given companies more affordable access to overseas profits, and Porat said Alphabet would make a “modest increase” in share buybacks with an additional allocation of $8.6 billion. The growing use of smartphones worldwide has been a bonanza for social media company Facebook Inc and Google, which research firm EMarketer estimates together account for nearly 60 percent of mobile ad sales. Google sells ad space on its search engine, its fast-growing YouTube video streaming service and a network of third-party websites and apps. The company’s computer algorithms have become more effective at delivering mobile ads likely to make customers sit through commercials, install an app or visit a website. Led by such ads, Alphabet generated $110.9 billion in full-year revenue, up 23 percent from 2016 and topping $100 billion for the first time. Profit fell 35 percent to $12.6 billion because of the tax bill and a separate charge last summer for a $2.7 billion European Union antitrust fine, which is under appeal. “The company’s continued strong top-line growth and myriad new opportunities to drive future growth remain the keys to the stock,” MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said in an email. Alphabet is attempting to maintain sales growth through new businesses, experimenting with operating a fleet of self-driving taxis through Waymo and licensing medical technology at Verily. Non-advertising revenue from Google combined with revenue from Verily and the other Alphabet companies was $15.5 billion in 2017, accounting for about 14 percent of total revenue, compared to $10.9 billion, or 12 percent, in 2016. Alphabet also said on Thursday that veteran board member John Hennessy took over as chairman the day before from Eric Schmidt, a long-time Google executive who will remain a board member and technical adviser.

"(Reuters) - Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc fell 4 percent premarket on Friday, as investors were concerned about the company’s rising costs and pressure on margins that are weighing on a profitable ad business. The Google logo is shown reflected on an adjacent office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike BlakeMost analysts believe higher investments by Alphabet to boost its cloud offerings and hardware sales could put pressure on the search engine’s margin expansion in fiscal 2018. “Operating margin and profit dollars fell short of our estimates despite the top line beat given higher contribution from lower margin streams of revenue (hardware),” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a client note. The company’s total traffic acquisition costs, a measure of how much money the company spends to attract users to its search engine, rose 33 percent in the fourth quarter to $6.45 billion. Canaccord Genuity analysts said Alphabet’s sequential gross margin contraction was the largest in the company’s history. However, some analysts looked past the costs and focused on a strong core ad business as well as positive comments from Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai on its fast-growing cloud computing business. Investments are paying off, Pichai said, noting that cloud computing is generating $1 billion in quarterly sales. Google sells ad space on its search engine, its fast-growing YouTube video streaming service and a network of third-party websites and apps. Led by such ads, Alphabet generated $110.9 billion in full-year revenue, up 23 percent from 2016 and topping $100 billion for the first time. But threats from Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc loom. “Amazon has grown its position as the first destination for consumer product searches. This has the potential to cannibalize Google’s revenue from retail advertisers,” wrote Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel who cut his rating to “hold” from “buy”. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on Alphabet, while two cut their price on the stock. Susquehanna was the most bullish, raising its price target to $1,475.Jefferies analysts said Alphabet is placing the right bets on some very big opportunities such as YouTube/TV, hardware, GCP, Waymo, which will help fuel sustained growth and meaningful share appreciation over time.

"(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc missed quarterly profit forecasts as steady ad sales growth was offset by increased spending to promote its consumer gadgets, YouTube video app and cloud computing services, the U.S. technology company said on Thursday. Shares of Alphabet dipped more than 5 percent after-hours, before steadying with a 2.7 percent loss at $1,149.93. Though growing demand for pricey ads on mobile apps has kept Google’s core ad business surging, the company has moved aggressively to maintain dominance and diversify sales. Expenses jumped 27 percent to $24.7 billion in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period. Google bought ads during major sports events to market its new Pixel 2 smartphone and YouTube television service. It slashed prices on other hardware in the race to get online search and media streaming devices into people’s homes. Google continued to quickly add staff to its enterprise sales unit. A growing portion of revenue has been spent on having the Google search engine set as the default option on products and services such as Apple Inc’s iPhone and Mozilla’s Firefox browser. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts in a post-earnings conference call that higher marketing costs coincided with holidays and that payments to partners such as Apple and Mozilla would steady in coming quarters. Investments are paying off, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said, noting that cloud computing is generating $1 billion in quarterly sales. He said Google’s G Suite workplace software package had doubled its customers to 4 million in two years, as Reuters first reported earlier on Thursday. Financial analysts looked past the spending. “Overall, it was a good quarter. Advertising revenue is still up significantly,” Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said in an email. Fourth-quarter sales increased 24 percent to $32.3 billion, above the average analysts’ estimate of $31.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted quarterly profit of $6.8 billion, or $9.70 per share, missed estimates of $7 billion, or $10 per share. Related CoverageAlphabet shares fall as rising costs, margin pressure roil investorsThe profit figure excludes a $9.9 billion tax charge as Alphabet joined much of corporate America in reporting large one-time expenses in the fourth quarter due to U.S. legislation enacted in December that lowers corporate rates. The tax law has given companies more affordable access to overseas profits, and Porat said Alphabet would make a “modest increase” in share buybacks with an additional allocation of $8.6 billion. The growing use of smartphones worldwide has been a bonanza for social media company Facebook Inc and Google, which research firm EMarketer estimates together account for nearly 60 percent of mobile ad sales. Google sells ad space on its search engine, its fast-growing YouTube video streaming service and a network of third-party websites and apps. The company’s computer algorithms have become more effective at delivering mobile ads likely to make customers sit through commercials, install an app or visit a website. Led by such ads, Alphabet generated $110.9 billion in full-year revenue, up 23 percent from 2016 and topping $100 billion for the first time. Profit fell 35 percent to $12.6 billion because of the tax bill and a separate charge last summer for a $2.7 billion European Union antitrust fine, which is under appeal. “The company’s continued strong top-line growth and myriad new opportunities to drive future growth remain the keys to the stock,” MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said in an email. Alphabet is attempting to maintain sales growth through new businesses, experimenting with operating a fleet of self-driving taxis through Waymo and licensing medical technology at Verily. Non-advertising revenue from Google combined with revenue from Verily and the other Alphabet companies was $15.5 billion in 2017, accounting for about 14 percent of total revenue, compared to $10.9 billion, or 12 percent, in 2016. Alphabet also said on Thursday that veteran board member John Hennessy took over as chairman the day before from Eric Schmidt, a long-time Google executive who will remain a board member and technical adviser.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo The potential for further regulation on privacy, monopolistic business practices or content vetting is among investors’ top concerns about tech companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc that are tapping their unrivaled consumer behavior data to branch beyond their core businesses. MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson said in a note to clients last month that Google had “the most unrecognized value” of big publicly traded tech companies despite some concerns about regulatory issues.

"02-10-2018"	"UPDATE 8-Waymo accepts $245 mln and Uber's 'regret' to settle self-driving car dispute "	"https://www.reuters.com/article/alphabet-uber-trial/update-8-waymo-accepts-245-mln-and-ubers-regret-to-settle-self-driving-car-dispute-idUSL2N1PZ11B"	"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 9 Uber Technologies Inc will pay $245 million worth of its own shares to Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving vehicle unit to settle a legal dispute over trade secrets, allowing Uber's chief executive to move past one of the company's most bruising public controversies."	"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] will pay $245 million worth of its own shares to Alphabet Inc’s Waymo self-driving vehicle unit to settle a legal dispute over trade secrets, allowing Uber’s chief executive to move past one of the company’s most bruising public controversies. The settlement announcement on Friday brought an abrupt halt to the captivating case just before the fifth day of testimony was to begin at a jury trial in federal court in San Francisco. In a lawsuit filed last year, Waymo said that one of its former engineers who became chief of Uber’s self-driving car project took with him thousands of confidential documents. The lawsuit cost Uber precious time in its self-driving car ambition, which is a key to its long-term profitability. Uber fired its self-driving chief after Waymo sued, and it is well behind on its plans to deploy fleets of autonomous cars in one of the most lucrative races in Silicon Valley. The settlement allows Uber’s chief executive officer, Dara Khosrowshahi, to put another scandal behind the company and move ahead with development of self-driving technology, following the tumultuous leadership by former CEO Travis Kalanick, who testified at the trial on Tuesday and Wednesday. As part of the deal, Waymo gets a 0.34 percent stake in Uber, worth about $245 million based on Uber’s current $72 billion valuation, a Waymo representative said. The settlement includes an agreement to ensure that Waymo confidential information is not being incorporated into Uber technology, which Waymo has said was its main goal in bringing the lawsuit. In settlement talks last year, Waymo had sought at least $1 billion from Uber, and wanted an independent monitor to ensure that Uber would not use Waymo technology in the future, Reuters reported. Waymo also asked for an apology. Uber rejected those terms as non-starters. Waymo had agreed earlier this week to a settlement proposal valued at $500 million, and Khosrowshahi brought the proposal to the Uber board of directors, offering his support. But Uber’s board rejected those terms on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the discussions said, sending Khosrowshahi and chief legal officer Tony West back to renegotiate. In the interim, the famously pugnacious Kalanick testified in court, maintaining a calm demeanor as he answered questions about Uber’s soured relationship with Alphabet and his admiration for Anthony Levandowski, the self-driving-car engineer whose actions led to the lawsuit. After four days of testimony, Waymo had presented little public evidence that Uber used Waymo’s trade secrets. By late Thursday, Waymo agreed to the $245 million deal, one of the sources said. In a statement on Friday, Khosrowshahi expressed “regret” for Uber’s actions. “While we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymo’s proprietary information in its self-driving technology, we are taking steps with Waymo to ensure our Lidar and software represents just our good work,” Khosrowshahi said in a statement. Related CoverageUber rejected $500 million settlement with Waymo earlier this weekLidar is a light-based sensor crucial to autonomous driving. Neither company offered details on what those steps will entail. Shares of Alphabet closed up 3.8 percent on Friday. Elizabeth Rowe, a professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law, analyzed about 150 trade secret verdicts through 2014 and said $245 million would rank as the second highest. Given that landscape, along with the fact that Alphabet CEO Larry Page could have had to testify next week, the settlement makes sense for Waymo, she said. “Their risks would have gone up on many levels,” Rowe said. Waymo’s lawsuit said that Levandowski had downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files containing designs for autonomous vehicles in December 2015 before he went on to work at Uber in 2016. The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a separate, criminal investigation into the trade secrets. Levandowski has never publicly addressed the allegations of taking the documents and law enforcement has not charged anyone with their theft. Levandowski was not a defendant in the case. SERIES OF PROBLEMS AT UBER The Waymo lawsuit was the most pressing legal battle for Uber, but only one item in a long list of controversies that has dogged the company for the last year. Public accusations of sexual harassment and a toxic workplace prompted an internal investigation at Uber that resulted in more than 20 people being fired, and the company faces multiple federal criminal probes. The company has also suffered from turmoil at the top with the ousting of Kalanick in June and a bitter board dispute. Uber had planned to have self-driving cars in 20 cities by the end of 2018, 50 cities by 2019 and 150 by 2020, according to documents shown in court. It is far from achieving those ambitions. Uber now has small pilots in Tempe, Arizona, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Although it has acquired the necessary California permit, it still does not have self-driving cars transporting passengers there. The settlement increases Alphabet’s stake in Uber from an initial investment of $258 million in 2013, which at the time was Uber’s largest fundraising round. Uber has gone on to raise more than $14 billion in new funding and last month closed a deal with SoftBank Group Corp, in which the Japanese conglomerate, along with other investors, took about a 17.5 percent stake in the company. SoftBank bought the majority of its stake at about a 30 percent discount from Uber’s valuation. Autonomous cars offer a multi-billion-dollar opportunity to remake urban transportation systems, and companies including Apple Inc, General Motors Co and scores of startups are competing to develop the technology.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoTo prevail in the trial, Waymo would have had to prove not only that Uber acquired Waymo’s trade secrets, but that it used them in its own technology. Kalanick in a statement on Friday said the path to victory was clear: Uber’s sole objective was to hire the most talented scientists and engineers and it had never possessed trade secrets. “Had the trial proceeded to its conclusion, it is clear Uber would have prevailed,” Kalanick said.

"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global stock picker Kerr Neilson, dubbed “Australia’s Warren Buffett,” said he will step down as chief executive officer of listed fund manager Platinum Investment Management (PTM.AX), sending its shares almost 12 percent lower. “It really is time for me to focus on fewer things and do those well, rather than try and cover this whole global investing scenario,” Neilson told Reuters on Friday. Neilson, who founded the fund with the backing of U.S. investor George Soros 24 years ago and became one of Australia’s richest men overnight when he floated it in 2007, will remain executive director. But his departure from day-to-day business, wiping as much as A$800 million ($626 million) from the market capitalization of Platinum, illustrates the vulnerability of fund managers in particular to “key man risk,” since it can trigger clients to pull their assets. Bill Gross’s abrupt departure from United States asset manager PIMCO in 2014 sent funds flowing away from the group, while BlueBay, one of Europe’s biggest asset managers, closed a $1.4 billion hedge fund the same year when manager Neil Phillips left. Platinum shares posted their sharpest drop in three years on Friday, dropping as much as 17.5 percent to a four-month low of A$6.45. They closed 12 percent lower while the broader market rose 0.8 percent. “Of course they’ll lose some mandates but they’re big enough for that,” said Geoff Wilson, founder and chairman at Wilson Asset Management (WAM.AX), which holds Platinum shares. Platinum has A$27.1 billion in funds under management and announced Nielson’s departure with its half-year results, which beat analyst expectations, after the market closed on Thursday. Neilson has focused the fund on Asian investments, but said a mid-1990s investment in IBM (IBM.N), and timely purchases of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) are among his best-performing picks. “The tech bubble we played beautifully; we’ve been quite good at big turning points,” he said. “Then the big balls-ups: I stayed too long in my shorts the whole of 2008 onwards,” he said listing Walmart as a short target that had soared. “But we’ve outperformed even with that ... so there’s a system in the stock selection here that is pretty robust.” Neilson, who steps down on July 1, will be replaced as chief executive by younger co-founder Andrew Clifford. Neilson said he closely studied individual stocks, often paying as much A$600 per hour to interview former executives. “You get a profile that is much deeper than simply the numbers,” Neilson said. “We try to find when there’s been a disproportionate action to an event and then the analysis lies in assessing whether that event is character-changing or not.” Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Stephen CoatesOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Online education company Udacity, which offers courses in high-tech subjects such as machine learning, said on Tuesday it more than doubled its annual revenue last year and added about 34,000 new students to its online degree programs. The company, founded by Sebastian Thrun, one of Silicon Valley’s pioneers in self-driving cars, said it increased revenue to $70 million in 2017 from $29 million the prior year. The privately held company has never before publicly released its revenue numbers. Chief Executive Officer Vishal Makhijani said in an interview that Udacity’s aspirations to one day become a public company prompted the startup to release a small slice of its financial information, in hopes of giving investors confidence in its business model. California-based Udacity started in 2014 offering online courses, which last six months on average, in technology fields including self-driving cars, flying cars and robotics. Makhijani, who replaced Thrun as CEO two years ago, said the revenue growth was fueled by student enrollment, which last year grew to more than 50,000 from 16,000. Udacity generates most of its revenue from tuition, which ranges from about $1,000 to $2,400 for a course. Udacity said it places graduates in tech industry jobs through partnership with more than 120 companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Lyft Inc, Uber Technologies Inc, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Mercedes Benz and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O). Makhijani said the talent pool is not big enough to satisfy the demands from tech companies. “The supply-demand imbalance is so out of whack,” he said. Because the company is still young, it is unclear how Udacity graduates perform compared to other employees in their field. Many Udacity students work in the technology industry but want to learn new skills, like how to build software for self-driving cars, Makhijani said. Others recognize that their jobs will soon be replaced by automation and want to change careers. “It’s no longer that you get educated once and it lasts a lifetime,” Makhijani said. “Technology trends are compressing the period of time that skills are marketable.” Udacity is not profitable, but still has more than $100 million from investors in the bank, Makhijani said. Udacity has offices in India, China, Germany and the United Arab Emirates. The company has raised $163 million to date and was valued at $1 billion at its last funding round. It is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Drive Capital and Alphabet’s venture capital arm, GV, among other investors.

"(Adds details on Alphabet share price growth, projections on hitting $1 trillion level) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, March 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc, the world’s most valuable publicly listed company, is in danger of being beaten by Amazon.com Inc to the $1 trillion mark. Wall Street’s optimism about last year’s 10th anniversary iPhone had propelled Apple’s stock 24 percent higher over the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $893 billion. That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world’s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been quickly closing the gap. Amazon’s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market. In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon’s ability to disrupt markets. Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February. At $783 billion, Alphabet Inc has the second largest market capitalization. The Google parent company’s stock has grown about 33 percent over the past year, faster than Apple but far slower than Amazon. Meanwhile, optimism about Apple’s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected. To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards. But if Amazon’s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company’s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year. Alphabet would not reach $1 trillion until 2019 if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year. Most Wall Street analysts are not quite that enthusiastic about the growth of Apple and Amazon. Analysts on average expect Apple’s stock price to rise 11 percent and reach $195 within the next 12 months, which would put its market capitalization at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

"* CEO presents his first 3-year strategic plan * Targets 4 pct organic sales growth in 2020 * Aims to boost margins through cost cuts, acquisitions * Ad market remains “very challenging” By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle Barzic PARIS, March 20 (Reuters) - France’s Publicis is doubling down on its efforts to become a consulting partner for global advertisers online in the hope to reverse sluggish growth and beef up margins over the next three years. The world’s third-biggest advertising group said on Tuesday it is targeting underlying sales growth of 4 percent in 2020, up from 0.8 percent last year, by tapping its digital arm Publicis.Sapient and fostering greater collaboration between its myriad of agencies. The target is part of a three-year strategic plan to be unveiled by chief executive Arthur Sadoun in London on Tuesday in a key test since he succeeded company veteran Maurice Levy, amid lower spending from big clients and the emergence of Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook as ad giants online. The plan, dubbed “Sprint to the Future”, confirms the group’s shift toward using technology to offer both creative content and tools for firms looking to tap a greater number of consumers. Publicis now regularly pitches against consultancy firm Accenture for new accounts, Sadoun has said previously. Shares of Publicis and bigger rivals WPP and Omnicom have underperformed benchmark stock indexes over the last year, as investors penalized disappointing results and weak forecasts, with WPP - the worst performer among the three - expecting flat growth this year in 2018. Having dropped an earlier operating margin rate forecast of at least 17.3 percent this year, Publicis said it still saw room for improvement and is now targeting a margin of maximum 17 percent in 2020, up from 15.5 percent last year. “The challenge is to justify how we can progress like this while maintaining the growth,” said Sadoun in a late Monday call with reporters. “The market is not expecting these numbers.” COST CUTS On top of growing sales, the expected increase in margins will come from a 450 million-euro ($555 million) cost saving plan over the next three years, Publicis said, about two thirds of which will be redeployed to hire and train employees. The group is hoping to boost profits from targeted acquisitions totalling between 300 and 500 million euros per year between 2018 and 2020, including companies in the fields of data and “business transformation.” For Publicis, the challenge remains to prove that Sapient, which weighed heavily in a 1.4 billion-euro writedown in 2016, is well integrated into the company and will improve results, analysts have said. The recent signing of multi-year contract with Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz brand to become its global digital agency and the winning of a media account with hotels group Marriott are proof that Publicis is on the right track, Sadoun said. “There will be bumps in the road… It’s not going to be easy,” he said. “It is a very challenging market.” ($1 = 0.8103 euros) (Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain and Gwenaelle Barzic Editing by Shri Navaratnam)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The quartet of technology stocks that has driven Wall Street indices to record highs in recent years may be breaking up, possibly undermining one of the best growth stories in a nine-year bull market. A specialist trader works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidFacebook (FB.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) tumbled this week as the benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX fell back toward lows seen in February, when the index gave back more than 10 percent in 10 days after reaching a record high in January. Netflix (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), which along with Facebook and Alphabet make up the so-called “FANG” stocks, did not do as badly as the S&P 500 index this week, falling 4.0 percent, compared to the index’s 6.0 per cent fall. But growing concerns about potential government regulation in the U.S. and Europe in response to privacy issues have investors assessing whether they may be forced to choose between those technology stocks leading the new economy. “The big, consumer-facing tech companies have been stock market leaders for years, and this could be the beginning of the end of that leadership. However, the long-term tech growth story is far from over,” Guild Investment Management Executive Vice President Tim Shirata wrote in a note this week. The outcry over Facebook’s handling of users’ data this week has bled $75 billion from the social media company’s stock market value, with concerns about potential regulation of internet companies also hurting Alphabet. Facebook fell 13 percent for the week and is down nearly 20 percent from its record high, while Alphabet lost nearly 10 percent this week and is 14 percent off its record high. Amazon lost nearly 10 percent also for the week but is only 8 percent off its record, while Netflix lost 5.4 percent and is nearly 10 percent from its high. Apple (AAPL.O), which became a stock portfolio cornerstone following the iPhone’s debut in 2007, is also about 10 percent off its record high. Amazon this week overtook Alphabet as the world’s second largest company by market capitalization at around $747 billion compared to $730 billion for Alphabet, but is still behind the largest company Apple worth $860 billion, according to Reuters data. “The FANG complex needs to go away,” said Joel Kulina, senior vice president of institutional cash equities at Wedbush. “You can’t compare Facebook and Google to Amazon anymore because they’re going in different directions and disrupting different parts of the world.” Illustrative of the consumer and political backlash against Facebook, the world’s largest social media network, the verified Facebook page of rocket company SpaceX disappeared on Friday, minutes after its founder and Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk promised on Twitter to take down the page when challenged by a user. Since February 2013, when CNBC television host Jim Cramer popularized the term FANG to describe the four must-own stocks, each has provided massive rewards to investors, with Facebook and Amazon gaining over 400 percent, Netflix climbing over 1,000 percent, and Alphabet nearly tripling its stock price. STILL MOSTLY BULLISH Criticism about the misuse of Facebook and Alphabet’s platforms during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign has worried investors for several months. European governments are already taking action to deal with risks to the privacy of user data, as well to limit what is seen as unfair competition in a move reminiscent of regulatory action against Microsoft (MSFT.O) nearly 20 years ago. Regulatory risk became a bigger issue this week after the revelation that Facebook mistakenly let 50 million users’ data get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Longer term though investors remain mostly bulllish on all four stocks and this week’s privacy scandal has not led analysts to meaningfully change their expectations for Facebook or Alphabet’s stocks. Investors disagree about which FANG stocks will lead in the future. Gullane Capital Partners, a hedge fund in Memphis, Tennessee, owns Amazon and Alphabet, and has occasionally shorted Netflix in recent years, betting the streaming company’s meteoric rise would be followed by a steep pullback. “I want to own Amazon for the next 25 years. It’s the most powerful business since Wal-Mart or Microsoft in their heydays,” said Gullane Capital Managing Partner Trip Miller. Miller attributed recent selling in Facebook, which his fund does not own, more to profit-taking than to a seismic change in how the company is viewed on Wall Street. The growing divergence in views on the four Wall Street powerhouses comes as investors more broadly reduce their appetite for the technology stocks which have led Wall Street’s rally in recent years. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX on Friday slumped 3.3 percent, hammered by fears of a trade war with China after President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. In the latest week ended Wednesday March 21, U.S.-based technology sector funds attracted just $158 million of net new cash, down sharply from inflows of $1.95 billion the previous week, according to Lipper data on Thursday. Guild Investment Management’s Shirata recommends buying technology stocks less likely to catch the eye of government regulators, and he pointed to networking, videogames and cloud computing companies. “In all these areas, prospects for long-term growth still look stunningly good.” he wrote.

The hearing follows allegations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consultancy, gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users, prompting the Federal Trade Commission to launch an investigation. Senator Charles Grassley, the committee’s chairman, said he invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg “to testify at the hearing to discuss Facebook’s past and future policies regarding the protection and monitoring of consumer data.” Facebook is facing pressure from advertisers as the social network struggles with government scrutiny following the allegations. Zuckerberg last week apologized for mistakes that Facebook made in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users. A Facebook spokesman said the company had received the hearing invitation and was reviewing it. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Google parent Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The hearing could be the highest-profile appearance by technology companies amid growing calls to regulate the industry. “The hearing will broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use.” Grassley said. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.” Last week, the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee formally invited Zuckerberg to testify and the Senate Commerce Committee also invited him to appear. Neither committee has set a date for a hearing. Facebook executives spent Wednesday and Thursday on Capitol Hill briefing congressional committee staffers. Zuckerberg said last week he would be willing to testify if he is the right person at the company to speak to lawmakers.

The Boeing building is seen next to Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, U.S., March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Lindsey WassonWith Saudi Arabia intending to localize 50 percent of its military industry by 2030, it is in discussions with U.S. companies to scale up their operations in the kingdom. To that end, Ahmed Al Khateeb of Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) said it will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) - a document which outweighs a letter of intent but does commit either side to the agreement - with Boeing in Seattle. “Hopefully we will be announcing other MoUs with other big American companies,” Khateeb told Reuters on the sidelines of the 2018 Saudi-U.S. CEO Forum in New York. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is leading a whistle-stop visit to the United States and on Friday is scheduled to travel to the U.S. West Coast. At the forum, Saudi Arabia’s U.S. embassy said the kingdom had signed 36 memorandums of understanding, totaling more than $20 billion in new business partnerships. The memorandums of understanding included a partnership between Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) and oil giant Saudi Aramco for national cloud services, and a cooperation agreement between Aramco and Raytheon Co (RTN.N) for national cyber security services. Aramco has been the victim of a high-profile cyber attack in the past, with former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta describing the 2012 so-called Shamoon attack as perhaps the most destructive cyber attack on a private business. In addition to cultivating Western ties for investments in Saudi Arabia, the trip is an opportunity for the crown prince to try to reassure investors who were unnerved by the severity and secrecy of an anti-corruption crackdown last November. CEO’s in attendance at the forum included Morgan Stanley’s (MS.N) James Gorman, Ajay Banga from Mastercard (MA.N) and PepsiCo’s (PEP.O) Indra Nooyi, according to an attendee list.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Waymo will include up to 20,000 Jaguar I-PACE electric vehicles in its upcoming autonomous fleet as part of a long-term partnership between Alphabet Inc’s self-driving unit and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc, the two companies said on Tuesday. A Jaguar I-PACE self-driving car is pictured during its unveiling by Waymo in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe electric Jaguar SUVs will join Chrysler Pacifica minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in Waymo’s robo-taxi fleets. “You will see increasing diversity in our fleet mix as we go forward,” Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik told Reuters on Tuesday. Waymo has previously said it is discussing a collaboration with Honda Motor Co Ltd. “Honda makes a lot of products, in a lot of different product categories,” Krafcik said, without elaborating further. Honda’s vehicle lineup includes fuel cell and battery electric Clarity models, as well as conventional cars, SUVs, vans and a pickup truck. The partnership, announced ahead of the New York International Auto Show, is another step in Waymo’s plan to roll out a robotaxi service in the United States. Waymo is competing with rivals General Motors Co and Uber Technologies to deploy such vehicles for the masses. Testing of the vehicles will begin this year and they will be incorporated into the fleet starting in 2020, Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik said. By 2022, there could be as many as 20,000 electric vehicles able to conduct about 1 million trips a day. Jaguar’s I-PACE launched this month. The SUV is the first battery-powered vehicle for the brand, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors Ltd, underscoring the convergence of electrification and automation. Jaguar Land Rover Chief Executive Ralf Speth said the company had been approached by Waymo about the project. Company executives said the talks and development had been underway for about a year. Speth said the company is confident the Waymo technology is safe. Waymo currently tests its self-driving system on Chrysler Pacifica minivans built by Fiat Chrysler. The company has plans to roll out a ride service to the public in the Phoenix, Arizona area in coming months, with plans to later launch it more widely. Waymo has been working on self-driving cars since 2009 and has driven over 5 million miles on public roads. Last month, it released a video designed to help potential passengers envision what it is like to ride inside an autonomous vehicle. The push comes as Waymo and automakers are heavily lobbying Congress to adopting sweeping legislation to speed the deployment of autonomous vehicles without human controls. But that legislation is on hold amid questions over the safety of self-driving vehicles following the March 18 death of a pedestrian struck by a self-driving Uber test vehicle in Arizona. On Saturday, Krafcik said Waymo’s system would have seen and avoided the pedestrian. Arizona’s governor suspended testing by Uber on Monday. Waymo is moving ahead with its plans to launch a driverless service, Krafcik said. He said the company, which has been working on the technology for nine years, is confident that “what we’re putting on the road is safe technology.” Uber announced last year that it planned to buy up to 24,000 vehicles from Volvo, owned by China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd, in a nonexclusive deal from 2019 to 2021. Companies planning to launch driverless car services generally supplement existing hardware on vehicles supplied by automakers with their own self-driving technology. Toyota Motor Corp said last week it was temporarily pausing autonomous vehicle testing following the Uber crash on U.S. public roads to help its test drivers, who could be experiencing “an emotional effect” from the incident. Slideshow (5 Images)Bill Fay, senior vice president of automotive operations at Toyota North America, said Tuesday in an interview at an event in New York he did not know long the pause would last. He said the company plans a “gradual” safe approach to self-driving vehicles. “We all have to build some trust into the technology and obviously this would be a little bit of a setback,” Fay said. General Motors North America President Alan Batey told reporters in Monday in New York that the automaker’s “development process will continue.” The Detroit automaker wants U.S. regulators to approve the use of self-driving cars without human controls for use next year in ride-sharing fleets.

"CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out a new iPad and classroom software aimed at grabbing more of the U.S. education market, but did not cut the price of its entry-level tablet despite schools flocking to laptops costing a third less. Apple is looking to reassert dominance in U.S. schools, where inexpensive laptops running software from Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp now top iPad by sales, offering a cheap way to get to cloud-based productivity tools. The new iPad has a more powerful computing chip and an extensive set of new, free software for teachers to manage students and schoolwork. But the unchanged starting price of $299 for students and $329 for the general public, without a keyboard or case, compares with less than $200 for some Windows and Google Chrome models. Apple shares were down 1.4 percent to $170.26 after the event, slightly better than the NASDAQ Composite, which was down 1.6 percent in midday trading. Some analysts had believed Apple might cut prices, but the company stuck with its more traditional approach of packing more features into a device. Despite the new software, Apple faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft’s productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google’s G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments. “Most teachers don’t look past G Suite for education,” she said. Apple, as part of its response, on Tuesday announced improvements in its iWork suite at an event in Chicago, where school bells and announcements over a public address system directed press and more than 300 teachers into an auditorium at Lane Tech College Prep High School. The event came during a spring buying season when many schools are making purchasing decisions for the upcoming school year. “We’ve been at this for 40 years and we care deeply about education,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the event. Apple's Vice-President of iOS, iPad and iPhone Product Marketing, Greg Joswiak, speaks at an education-focused event at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., March 27, 2018. REUTERS/John GressApple executives said the new iPad works with its pencil accessory and features an upgraded A10 Fusion chip, the same CPU that powers the iPhone 7. It is available immediately. The Apple Pencil remains priced at $99 for the public and $89 for schools, though Lenovo will release a device called Crayon for $49, the first third-party stylus to work with the iPad. Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google’s Chrome and 22 percent had Windows. Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc cost as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from Lenovo Group Ltd running Windows 10 S for a similar price. Acer Inc announced a tablet that runs Chrome OS for $329 on Monday that comes with a built-in stylus. Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage students. On Tuesday it updated iWork - which includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software - to allow students to take handwritten notes more easily, along with adding more free storage on its iCloud service. Apple also released a new app called Schoolwork to help teachers create assignments and track student progress. Google has a similar app for managing student profiles, but analysts highlighted Apple’s Schoolwork app as unique in helping teachers manage assignments and progress. The previously iPad-focused Classroom teacher administration app would start working on Mac computers in June, Apple said. In the fall Apple will roll out “Everyone Can Create” lessons on video, photography, music, and drawing, joining existing “Everyone Can Code” guides for computer programming skills. Slideshow (12 Images)The new courses highlight features that some low-priced laptops do not have, such as a camera and microphone. “If you look at it as a Chromebook competitor, it’s expensive. But if you look at it and say, I can do music with GarageBand, I can take pictures or use it as a video camera and now I can do (augmented reality) ... it appeals to teachers and schools that want to push the envelope on education,” Milanesi said. Sales of iPads made up just 8.3 percent of Apple’s $229.2 billion total revenue last year, compared with the nearly 62 percent of sales generated by iPhones.

HTC on Monday reported a net loss of T$9.8 billion ($337.3 million) in the fourth quarter, its biggest on record, due in part to competition and inventory write-downs, but said it was upbeat going forward due to the Google deal. “HTC successfully completed the US$1.1 billion business co-operation agreement with Google at the end of January, and the gain related to the transaction will be recognised in Q1’18, enabling greater investment in emerging technologies, which will be vital across all of our businesses and present significant long-term growth opportunities,” the Taiwanese firm said in a statement. In September, Google said it would acquire part of HTC’s smartphone operations. HTC also said on Tuesday it had conducted a review of operations to optimize teams and processes to ensure greater co-ordination of its smartphone and virtual reality businesses.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks steadied on Thursday, after a woeful week for major technology companies, even as global equities careened towards their first quarterly drop in two years. The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Tilman BlasshoferShares tracked by the 47-country MSCI index glided 0.86 percent higher, with Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc retaking the market’s leadership mantle. Despite equities’ gains, safe-haven bonds also advanced in price. The volatile give-and-take during the week and quarter would seem to set the table for tense months ahead as buy-the-dip bulls look for corporate earnings to validate the market’s current levels and short-selling bears work to expose investors’ complacency. Yet David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co’s funds division, said he is optimistic that markets have clarified the effects of a large U.S. tax cut and the prospect for higher interest rates, factors he says challenged markets during the first quarter. “It’s not that the uncertainties have gone away on higher rates or lower taxes, but I think we’ve grown accustomed to them, and that should lay a foundation for investors to put more money to work,” he said. Economic data on Thursday showed U.S. consumer spending rising only marginally, but the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a more than 45-year low last week. Monthly inflation readings moderated. Those statistics helped keep downward price swings at bay on Thursday after a turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets that is set to end one of the longest quarterly bull runs and included the biggest-ever rise in Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the CBOE Volatility Index. A “melt-up” that sent the MSCI’s “all-country” world share index up more than 7 percent in January suddenly melted away as tensions over global trade escalated, turmoil deepened in the White House and market-leading technology firms wobbled on fears of regulation and other issues. The index is down more than 1 percent in price terms this year. Now, the Dow, S&P 500, FTSE, Nikkei and scores of other major indexes are all also down for the year. And there was little place to hide, with U.S. bond returns also in the red for the quarter. On Thursday, by contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.69 points, or 1.07 percent, to 24,103.11, the S&P 500 gained 35.87 points, or 1.38 percent, to 2,640.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 114.22 points, or 1.64 percent, to 7,063.45. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6 percent, while Shanghai closed up 1.2 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.2 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.44 percent. Oil continued its march higher. Benchmark Brent crude rose 1 percent, advancing its gains for the quarter and sidestepping data the day prior showing a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles. Many markets across Europe and the Americas will be closed on the final weekday of the quarter in observance of Good Friday. A monthly markets poll by Reuters showed trade war and tech sector worries have spooked global investors into cutting equity exposure to a four-month low and holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years. Roger Jones, the head of equities at London & Capital, said he hopes the equity market’s selloff from its highs is not prolonged. “The longer this goes, the higher the chance it will start to affect the man in the street,” said Jones. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose in price to yield 2.741 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Wednesday. That market action pushed the gap between short- and long-dated Treasury yields to its tightest in a decade. Some investors see the narrowing as a sign the economy will sputter. In addition to that curve flattening, the quarter was marked by a rise in short-term borrowing costs, reflected in the soaring London interbank offered rate (Libor).

And there was little place to hide, with U.S. bond returns also in the red for the quarter. On Thursday, by contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.69 points, or 1.07 percent, to 24,103.11, the S&P 500 gained 35.87 points, or 1.38 percent, to 2,640.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 114.22 points, or 1.64 percent, to 7,063.45. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6 percent, while Shanghai closed up 1.2 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.2 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.44 percent. Oil continued its march higher. Benchmark Brent crude rose 1 percent, advancing its gains for the quarter and sidestepping data the day prior showing a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles. Many markets across Europe and the Americas will be closed on the final weekday of the quarter in observance of Good Friday. A monthly markets poll by Reuters showed trade war and tech sector worries have spooked global investors into cutting equity exposure to a four-month low and holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years. Roger Jones, the head of equities at London & Capital, said he hopes the equity market’s selloff from its highs is not prolonged. “The longer this goes, the higher the chance it will start to affect the man in the street,” said Jones. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose in price to yield 2.741 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Wednesday. That market action pushed the gap between short- and long-dated Treasury yields to its tightest in a decade. Some investors see the narrowing as a sign the economy will sputter. In addition to that curve flattening, the quarter was marked by a rise in short-term borrowing costs, reflected in the soaring London interbank offered rate (Libor).

Shares of Facebook, Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft were up between 1 percent and 4 percent, driving a 1.7 percent gain in the S&P technology index . Still, the S&P 500 and the Dow are on track to log their worst quarter in more than two years on concerns over a global trade war and aggressive interest rate hikes, as well as a rout in technology stocks caused by the Facebook data scandal. “People are worried about rising interest rates. That has led to market volatility and we’ll see more of that,” said Mark Esposito, president of Esposito Securities LLC. Global investors have cut their equity exposure to a four-month low in March, according to a Reuters poll, while reducing their holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1635 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 253.56 points, or 1.06 percent. The S&P 500 was up 28.83 points, or 1.11 percent and the Nasdaq Composite rose 84.60 points, or 1.22 percent. All eleven major S&P 500 sectors were positive. Trading volumes are expected to be light, ahead of the long Easter weekend. Economic data released on Thursday did little to change the expectations of interest rate hikes. Core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge, rose 1.6 percent on an annualized basis through February, in line with economists’ expectations. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in January. Amazon fell more than 1 percent after President Donald Trump blasted the company with a list of complaints, a day after news website Axios reported that Trump wants to rein in the company’s growing power using federal antitrust laws.

"(Updates to U.S. equity market open; changes dateline, previous LONDON) * Gloom lifts off stocks after recent tech rout * World shares set for first quarterly loss in 2 years * Dollar steadies, Treasury yields move lower By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Riskier assets such as stocks steadied on Thursday, after a woeful week for giant technology companies, even as global equities careened towards their first quarterly drop in two years. Stock indexes tracked by the 47-country MSCI index glided 0.61 percent higher, as trading opened in New York with Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc retaking the market’s leadership mantle. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 239.46 points, or 1 percent, to 24,087.88, the S&P 500 gained 25.23 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,630.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.75 points, or 0.99 percent, to 7,017.98. Despite the equity gains, safe-haven bonds also advanced in price. The U.S. dollar weakened, stalling its sharp rise. The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets has brought an end to one of the longest quarterly bull runs, and there have been few places to hide. Investors have faced the biggest ever rise in stock volatility, rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening turmoil in the White House and major wobbles in the tech sector. A “melt-up” that sent the MSCI’s world share index up 8 percent in January suddenly melted away. Now, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, FTSE, Nikkei and scores of other major indexes are all down for the year. “We have got to make sure (the market selloff) ...is not too prolonged because the longer this goes, the higher the chance it will start to affect the man in the street,” said Roger Jones, the head of equities at London & Capital. Facebook, Apple and some of their peers were hurt this quarter as investors rethought high U.S. stock valuations in light of the prospect of a U.S.-China trade war and potentially increased regulation of tech companies. Reuters’ monthly markets poll showed the trade war and tech sector worries have spooked global investors into cutting their equity exposure to a four-month low and holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose in price to yield 2.7534 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Wednesday. That pushed the gap between U.S. short- and long-dated Treasuries to its tightest level in a decade. Some investors see a narrowing between those bonds’ yields as a sign the economy will sputter. For currency traders, the dollar settled too after a stronger-than-expected revision to U.S. fourth quarter economic growth data and hopes a nuclear standoff with North Korea has been averted gave it its largest daily gain in nearly seven months on Wednesday. An index of the greenback against its trading partners rose 0.08 percent. A 45-year low in jobless claims helped the tentative return of risk appetite, and U.S. inflation data also cooled safety plays including Treasuries and German Bunds. Oil managed a rebound despite data on Wednesday that showed a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. crude rose 0.62 percent to $64.78 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.11, up 0.51 percent on the day. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6 percent, while Shanghai closed up 1.2 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.3 percent.

"TORONTO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s urban innovation company Sidewalk Labs hopes to break ground on its first ever smart-city project in Toronto in 2020, and begin testing some of the proposed technologies this summer, its chief executive told Reuters. Daniel Doctoroff, Chief Executive Officer of Sidewalk Labs, poses for a portrait in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Carlo AllegriThis is the first time a timeline has been publicly disclosed for the project designed to increase land efficiency, cut costs and conserve energy in one of the world’s priciest housing markets as development struggles to catch up with a rapidly growing population. Government-backed agency Waterfront Toronto in March 2017 requested proposals to develop a 12-acre (4.86 hectares) environmentally friendly mixed-use area that would add jobs and be affordable for all ages and income brackets. That was the first part of the planned revitalization of about 800 acres of industrial wasteland to the east of the city’s downtown on Lake Ontario. Sidewalk Labs was chosen in October based on a proposal that included autonomous vehicles, a thermal grid that does not use fossil fuels, low-cost modular buildings with flexible uses, and robotic delivery and waste-management systems. The company settled on Toronto after searching for sites across North America, Europe and Australia to create a smart city. A development plan is expected to be approved by the Sidewalk and Waterfront Toronto boards by the end of 2018, and the first residents could move in as early as 2022, CEO Dan Doctoroff said in an interview. The timeline is subject to government approvals and other processes that Sidewalk expects to spend most of 2019 working through, Doctoroff said. “Quayside will be a prototype for a broader opportunity,” Doctoroff said. “What we’re trying to do, no one has really succeeded in doing. Thus far, I’ve been thrilled with the way things have gone ... but I’m not sanguine about the challenges.” Other smart city projects have largely failed because of budgets, the involvement of too many parties, and the use of public resources on development with no immediate benefits for the broader population. Corporate access to personal information is a growing concern. Sidewalk Labs has faced growing scrutiny over its plans to put sensors and cameras all over Quayside. Doctoroff said Sidewalk Labs would destroy non-essential information, only retain data that would improve the quality of life, and not sell them to advertisers. Third parties must adopt privacy policies developed for the plan, he added. Most of the technology will be sourced from several other companies, Doctoroff said. “It’s possible we might invest in (some of) them to encourage them or potentially to fund some of those things, but that will be a smaller percentage.” Sidewalk has invested $50 million for testing and engagement this year. It will lease a new waterfront office in summer, where it will showcase some Quayside technologies, he said. Sidewalk will have a better idea by year-end whether its partnership with Waterfront Toronto could extend to the broader eastern waterfront, he said. Some technologies can be effective in Quayside’s limited area, but others including mobility, energy and building systems need larger economies of scale to be effective, Doctoroff said. Sidewalk Labs has been approached by others to do similar projects elsewhere but is focused on Toronto for now, Doctoroff said. “We’ve got to get it right here.” Reporting by Nichola Saminather; Editing by Richard ChangOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"Apple's 50-megawatt solar farm, east of Apple’s data center in Mesa, Arizona is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters on April 9, 2018. Apple/Handout via REUTERS (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday said it had achieved its goal of powering all of the company’s facilities with renewable energy, a milestone that includes all of its data centers, offices and retail stores in 43 countries. The iPhone maker also said nine suppliers had recently committed to running their operations entirely on renewable energy sources like wind and solar, bringing to 23 the total number to make such a pledge. Major U.S. corporations such as Apple, Wal-Mart Inc (WMT.N) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have become some of the country’s biggest buyers of renewable forms of energy, driving substantial growth in the wind and solar industries. Alphabet’s Google last year purchased enough renewable energy to cover all of its electricity consumption worldwide. Costs for solar and wind are plunging thanks to technological advances and increased global production of panels and turbines, enabling companies seeking to green their images to buy clean power at competitive prices. “We’re not spending any more than we would have,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives, said in an interview. “We’re seeing the benefits of an increasingly competitive clean energy market.” Renewable energy projects that provide power to Apple facilities range from large wind farms in the United States to clusters of hundreds of rooftop solar systems in Japan and Singapore. The company has also urged utilities to procure renewable energy to help power Apple’s operations. Encouraging suppliers to follow suit in embracing 100 percent renewable energy is the next step for Apple. The suppliers that pledge to use more clean energy know they will have “a leg up” against competitors for Apple’s business, Jackson said. “We made it clear that over time this will become less of a wish list and more of a requirement,” she said.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration But a decision in the most important of three antitrust cases against Google - this one aimed at loosening its stranglehold over Android-powered smartphones - is likely to show just how difficult it is, even for a committed trust-buster like Vestager, to dent the power of the U.S. giants. The final ruling, expected within the next few months, will likely involve a multi-billion-dollar fine and an end to clauses in licensing agreements that stop smartphone vendors from promoting alternatives to apps such as Google Search and Maps, people familiar with the European Commission’s thinking say. The decision, which is expected to hew closely to recommendations made in 2016 soon after the probe began, will almost certainly leave Google’s market dominance intact because the incentives to stick with the company are so strong, say industry executives, analysts and even its foes. Robert Marcus, a former member of Microsoft’s mobile strategy team and now general partner at investment firm Quantum Wave Capital, said it was “virtually impossible” that any EU penalty would “change anything massively for Google.” The case holds lessons for regulators in Europe and elsewhere as they pursue Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon over practices including anti-competitive conduct, tax avoidance and a cavalier approach to user data and hate speech. German regulators have shown that targeted measures can force changes in a company’s conduct, such as compelling social media companies to quickly remove hate speech. Tax authorities can close loopholes and change laws to collect more money. But stimulating competition in markets where products and services are free is a far more difficult undertaking. “Once someone is entrenched, you can’t say, ‘stop’ and things get better,” said Mark Patterson, a Fordham University law professor who has researched Google antitrust issues. The Commission declined to comment on the case. Google did not respond to a request for comment. FEW ALTERNATIVES Google holds 90 percent of the European search market, meaning there are few plausible alternatives for handset makers or consumers who might want to opt out. Phone vendors will be reluctant to dump popular applications such as Google Maps even if they could do so freely. An executive at one major smartphone maker said European wireless carriers have told his company they would refuse to market phones without Google Search or the Google Play app store. Alternatives to Android remain scarce. And Google still has the option of going all-out with its own Pixel phones if new rules make licensing Android unappealing. Tom Moss, a former Google employee who wrote key parts of the first Android licensing agreements a decade ago, told Reuters tight control was necessary at the time, both to assure a standard platform for third-party software-makers to build Android apps and to guarantee customers a consistent experience. Moss, now with the gaming hardware company Razer, acknowledges that at this stage, however, “keeping all the same policies and approaches can seem heavy-handed, unfair and anticompetitive”. He added: “It’s not the end of the world” for Google that the EU is reassessing the arrangements. The EU’s Android investigation began in 2015 following a complaint two years earlier from lobbying group FairSearch, whose members at the time included competitors like Oracle, Nokia and Microsoft. Sources said Amazon also complained. A preliminary document from 2016, seen by Reuters, said regulators should levy a large fine and that Google should stop giving revenue sharing payments to smartphone makers to pre-install only Google Search, as well as stop requiring Google’s Chrome browser and other apps to be installed alongside Google’s Play store. The EU was not likely to go further than that recommendation, EU sources said. Ordering the company to divest its Android business altogether, for example, would be difficult to justify under European law, European Commission sources said. Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said in January the EU “could require more onerous changes” than it did last year in its inquiry into whether Google was favoring its own online shopping service in search results. In that case, Google was fined $2.4 billion euros - a large amount for most companies, but barely 2 percent of the company’s 2017 sales. Changes made by Google in response to the EU’s order did stoke more competition for certain ad slots, but because of the way Google’s ad auction system works that resulted in more money for the company without giving competitors enough of a leg up to gain market share. There’s still a possibility the Commission could compel Google to work with manufacturing partners that want to use modified versions of Android, allowing what is known as “forking” of the operating system, EU sources said. But the ruling almost certainly will not be enough to break Google’s monopolistic hold, FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said. “The Android case has taken too long, and ... Google has in large measure achieved the elimination of competition it sought,” Vinje said. Google is appealing the shopping verdict, and could also appeal any ruling in the Android case. RIVALS The big issue for Google is less what the EU might do than how the strategies of smartphone makers might evolve. Global leader Samsung Electronics has long pushed its own apps for messaging, Internet browsing and other functionality. Samsung could end its relationship with Google if it truly wanted to go in a different direction, Moss said. So far, however, Samsung has been unwilling to take that step. Among other things, doing so could drive customers to Google’s own Pixel smartphone because it comes with a full range of Google apps and often gets first access to new features. Other challenges could come from Amazon, Alibaba and other companies who might customize an “open source” version of Android that Google has made freely available for public use. There are few signs so far that any major smartphone vendors want to opt for a different operating system. Amazon tried to build its own phone with a modified version of Android several years ago, but it was a spectacular flop. Google’s rivals in searches and Internet browsers are holding out hope they’ll be better able to compete under a new EU regulatory regime. Guillaume Champeau, ethics and public relations officer at French search engine company Qwant, said an agreement it reached with a phone maker fell through last year because of Google’s rules.

Such deals would not be a big threat to Google. “Android is utterly dominant,” said technology analyst Geoff Blaber of CCS Insight. “Whatever the ruling, manufacturers are heavily reliant [on it] so nothing is going to change dramatically.” Additional reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Sonya HepinstallOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"(Reuters) - Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc lost more than 5 percent on Tuesday as a surge in costs drove what analysts said was its biggest ever contraction in gross margins, overshadowing strong first-quarter ad sales. FILE PHOTO: The Alphabet Inc. campus, also known as Googleplex, is shown in this aerial photo in Mountain View, California, U.S., April 6, 2016. REUTERS/Noah Berger/File PhotoThe dive in first-quarter operating margins, to 22 percent from 27 percent a year ago, follows a troubling six weeks for major U.S. tech players, now facing a more questioning public and the prospect of tighter official scrutiny on privacy issues. The fall in Alphabet shares following its first-quarter results on Monday evening turned them negative for the year and amounted to a roughly $37 billion reduction in the value of the Mountain View, California-based firm. Other members of the FAANG group of tech stocks that include Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc , Netflix Inc and Apple Inc also tracked that move lower. At least nine brokerages cut their price targets on Alphabet shares, compared to five who raised. But analysts were reluctant to place the blame as yet on the row over user data which has engulfed Facebook and threatens to encourage more regulation of internet companies. “There is regulatory risk, though we have yet to find evidence that regulations will adversely impact the usefulness of Google for consumers or advertisers,” RBC analysts said. Longer-term capital expenditures at Google nearly tripled to $7.3 billion in the first quarter from $2.5 billion a year ago. The company said that continuing cost increases came from acquiring streaming rights for YouTube’s new TV service and marketing new products. Google executives say the spending to install powerful computers and internet cables is necessary to keep up with demand for YouTube, its Google Assistant virtual helper service and data analytics tools within its Google Cloud services. “With YouTube’s rapid growth (also in non-ad-supported services) and a greater emphasis on hardware made by Google, we think this gross margin contraction will continue,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham wrote in a client note. “Gross margin contracted ~370 bps y/y, (that is) the largest contraction in company history.” Ad sales also suggested that there were no immediate signs of the privacy concerns affecting profits. Alphabet’s shares have risen 25 percent in the past year, making it the third best performing of the FAANG group, trailing only Amazon and Netflix. The sharp declines in FAANG stocks pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lower on Tuesday afternoon. Facebook and Amazon were each off nearly 4 percent, Netflix dipped 5 percent and Apple shed 1.6 percent. The technology sector sank 1.47 percent, making it the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.

The S&P 500 and the Dow fell the most in two-and-a-half weeks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down for a fifth day in a row. The S&P 500 is now down 1.5 percent year-to-date. The 10-year yield, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, has been driven steadily higher by a combination of concerns over inflation, growing debt supply and rising Federal Reserve borrowing costs. “It makes borrowing costs more expensive for corporations. This market rally for the last nine years has been driven by low interest rates, accommodating monetary policy and excess liquidity,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist for Bruderman Asset Management in New York. Higher bond yields could also prompt portfolio managers to weigh moving money into more attractive fixed-income securities at the expense of equities. The stock market had already been spooked by a climb in bond yields earlier in the year, sliding sharply in February. . Technology and industrial stocks weighed on the major indexes on Tuesday, with Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, 3M Co and Caterpillar Inc all falling more than 3.5 percent. Alphabet shares fell 4.7777 percent, erasing the stock’s year-to-date gains as rising expenses and shrinking margins overshadowed the company’s better-than-expected profit. Industrial bellwether Caterpillar tumbled 6.20 percent on fears of increasing steel prices, despite the company’s beating earnings estimates due to strong global demand. Diversified industrial manufacturer 3M was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shares fell 6.83 percent after the company posted in-line profits as lower taxes offset a miss in operating profits and the company lowered its 2018 earnings forecast. “We’re seeing some of the earnings numbers have come out, and after further review, (investors) realized where all this revenue was coming from,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “They didn’t see it as recurring or indicative of the core business. “I think what investors had hoped the benefit from taxes would get redeployed back into the company. That’s not happening,” Nolte said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 424.56 points, or 1.74 percent, to 24,024.13, the S&P 500 lost 35.73 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,634.56 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 121.25 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,007.35. Apple Inc shares lost 1.39 percent as worries over softening demand for high-end smartphones were underscored as Corning Inc reported a drop in screen glass sales for the first time in at least four quarters. Other technology stocks in the FAANG group, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, also weighed on the Nasdaq. “They’re kind of pulling each other down,” said Nolte. “Investors are saying, ‘You know, the group has had a tremendous run over the last two to three years, maybe we should take some money off the table here.’” Shares of Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon’s largest weapons supplier, dropped 6.17 percent. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and boosted its full-year sales and profit forecast but did not raise its 2018 cash-flow projections. So far, 24 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter results, with 77.1 percent coming in above the Street consensus, versus the 64 percent average since 1994. Analysts estimate 21.1 percent growth in earnings for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. On the economic front, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in April, according to the Conference Board, as short-term optimism improved and the share of consumers expecting their incomes to decline in the coming months hit its lowest level since December 2000. Oil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest level since November 2014, but then reversed course as U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to try to resolve U.S.-European differences on Iran, easing concerns that the United States might reinstate sanctions against Iran. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 21 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 61 new highs and 90 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.22 billion shares, compared to the 6.80 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Alphabet shares fell {GOOGL.O;-PCTCHNG:2}77 percent, erasing the stock’s year-to-date gains as rising expenses and shrinking margins overshadowed the company’s better-than-expected profit. Industrial bellwether Caterpillar tumbled {CAT;-PCTCHNG:2} percent on fears of increasing steel prices, despite the company’s beating earnings estimates due to strong global demand. Diversified industrial manufacturer 3M was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shares fell {MMM;-PCTCHNG:2} percent after the company posted in-line profits as lower taxes offset a miss in operating profits and the company lowered its 2018 earnings forecast. “We’re seeing some of the earnings numbers have come out, and after further review, (investors) realized where all this revenue was coming from,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “They didn’t see it as recurring or indicative of the core business. “I think what investors had hoped the benefit from taxes would get redeployed back into the company. That’s not happening,” Nolte said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average {.DJI;NETCHNG_1,PCTCHNG;[F1<0]fell -F1 points, or -F2 percent,[F1>0]rose F1 points, or F2 percent, remained unchanged} to {.DJI;TRDPRC_1}, the S&P 500 {.SPX;NETCHNG_1,PCTCHNG:2;[F1<0]lost -F1 points, or -F2 percent,[F1>0]gained F1 points, or F2 percent, remained unchanged} to {.SPX;TRDPRC_1} and the Nasdaq Composite {.IXIC;NETCHNG_1:2,PCTCHNG;[F1<0]dropped -F1 points, or -F2 percent,[F1>0]added F1 points, or F2 percent, remained unchanged} to {.IXIC;TRDPRC_1:2}. Apple Inc shares lost {AAPL.O;-PCTCHNG:2} percent as worries over softening demand for high-end smartphones were underscored as Corning Inc reported a drop in screen glass sales for the first time in at least four quarters. Other technology stocks in the FAANG group, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, also weighed on the Nasdaq. “They’re kind of pulling each other down,” said Nolte. “Investors are saying, ‘You know, the group has had a tremendous run over the last two to three years, maybe we should take some money off the table here.’” Shares of Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon’s largest weapons supplier, dropped {LMT;-PCTCHNG:2} percent. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and boosted its full-year sales and profit forecast but did not raise its 2018 cash-flow projections. So far, 24 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter results, with 77.1 percent coming in above the Street consensus, versus the 64 percent average since 1994. Analysts estimate 21.1 percent growth in earnings for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. On the economic front, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in April, according to the Conference Board, as short-term optimism improved and the share of consumers expecting their incomes to decline in the coming months hit its lowest level since December 2000. Oil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest level since November 2014, but then reversed course as U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to try to resolve U.S.-European differences on Iran, easing concerns that the United States might reinstate sanctions against Iran. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 21 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 61 new highs and 90 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.22 billion shares, compared to the 6.80 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Alphabet got a boost from how it values investments in Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and other startups. That accounting change and a one-time benefit cut its effective tax rate nearly in half. Investors are uncertain about future profit at Alphabet as the company navigates the move to a phone-based computing world and invests in small, fast-growing initiatives from self-driving cars to selling hardware and cloud computing services. The quarterly results did not clarify the outlook. Alphabet’s operating margin of 22 percent, down from 27 percent a year ago, missed expectations because of the growth in expenses. Alphabet is investing to keep pace with Amazon.com Inc and having to share more of its revenue with phone and browser makers, said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities. “The jump in profits is purely due to one-time items,” he said. Longer-term capital expenditures nearly tripled to $7.3 billion in the first quarter from $2.5 billion a year ago. Still, worldwide sales increased to $31.1 billion, above the average analysts’ estimate of $30.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Those ad sales showed investors that there were no immediate signs that rising global privacy concerns had affected profits, even as concerns over Facebook Inc’s use of privacy cast some suspicion on Google. Officials across the world seek to force changes in Google’s business practices, such as giving customers more control over their data. “The strong economy has companies spending more on advertising,” said analyst Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners. “Google continues to dominate both mobile and desktop search” and there will be “very little effect” from Facebook privacy data fallout, he said. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts Monday that, “It’s important to understand that most of our ad business is search, where we rely on very limited information, essentially what is in the keywords to show a relevant ad.” STARTUP INVESTMENTS BOOST PROFITS Alphabet’s quarterly profit of $9.4 billion, or $13.33 per share, exceeded estimates of $6.56 billion, or $9.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About $2.4 billion in earnings were attributable to a new accounting method for unrealized gains in Alphabet’s investments in startups such as Uber and Airbnb Inc. Alphabet now records estimates of the current value of its startup investments rather than waiting to report income once it has opportunity to sell those shares. That change and a one-time benefit drove the effective tax rate in the quarter to 11 percent from 20 percent a year earlier. Excluding the investment-related gains and other items, adjusted earnings were $9.93 per share. Google had several one-time costs including acquiring 2,000 employees in Taiwan for $1.1 billion from HTC Corp and moving up when it awards equity to employees. Continuing cost increases came from acquiring streaming rights for YouTube’s new TV service and marketing new products. Google executives say the spending to install powerful computers and internet cables is necessary to keep up with demand for YouTube, its Google Assistant virtual helper service and data analytics tools within its Google Cloud services. Revenue from Google’s non-advertising units was $4.4 billion in the first quarter. FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S., August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoAlphabet is paring back on “other bets,” a set of ancillary projects in areas such as medical technology and drones. Operating loss from “other bets” fell to $571 million, from $703 million a year ago. Investors are counting on one other bet, the Waymo self-driving vehicles effort, to generate noteworthy revenue this year as it begins offering ride-hailing services. Google revealed smart thermostat maker Nest generated about $726 million in revenue in 2017, above some analysts’ estimates. Financial results for Nest had not been released since its acquisition in 2014.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - China’s ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) held a conference call on Wednesday with major suppliers, during which a company representative suggested the trade dispute with Beijing may have been a factor in last week’s U.S. order banning American firms from selling goods to the smartphone maker, according to a person familiar with the call. FILE PHOTO: A ZTE smart phone is pictured in this illustration taken April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/Illustration/File PhotoThe Commerce Department last week banned American firms from doing business with ZTE after the company violated an agreement reached after it was caught selling U.S. goods to Iran despite U.S. sanctions. The ZTE representative on the call said it would be naive to think the ban was ordered in “a vacuum” and was assumed to be connected to the U.S.-China trade war, the person said. The U.S. has threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to warn that it would retaliate if Washington pushes ahead. The U.S. also has taken actions aimed at reducing access to the U.S. by ZTE and Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans. In response to a Reuters request for comment, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said late Wednesday that the order was “a law enforcement matter unrelated to broader trade policy,” according to a statement provided by a spokesman. The conference call took place between ZTE and more than a dozen members of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the person said. “It was a factual update on what happened, what they’ve done since the order was put in place, and what they’re doing to remedy the situation,” a Semiconductor Industry Association spokesman said. “There was no discussion of helping ZTE advocate before the U.S. government.” U.S. companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks. Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which is one of ZTE’s top suppliers, said on Wednesday the loss of ZTE’s business will hurt its third quarter earnings. Canalys, a technology consultancy, estimated that 65 percent of ZTE phones contain Qualcomm chips. It is not known whether a Qualcomm representative was on the ZTE call and the company declined to comment. A ZTE spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Aside from Qualcomm, ZTE’s other major business partners include Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and GlobalFoundries [CSMF.UL]. LETTER TO BUSINESS PARTNERS ZTE also sent a letter to its business partners on Wednesday, explaining why it believes the seven-year ban was a “drastic action” out of proportion to its misconduct. According to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters, ZTE said the order should be “very concerning to all,” since it took effect without warning to the industry, without waiting for the results of an independent internal investigation due at the end of the month, and without recognition for all the improvements in its export compliance program.   ZTE invested over $50 million in 2017 in improving its compliance program and planned to increase that spending this year, the letter says. The Commerce Department ban was ignited when ZTE admitted in March that while it had fired four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to 35 others when it said it had. In the letter, ZTE said that once it confirmed the employee bonuses were not reduced and reprimands not completed, it disclosed the information and took “immediate remedial action.”  The order “sends the wrong message” to other companies who may be considering settling with the Commerce Department over export control issues, ZTE said.   It said it was committed to complying with the order and U.S. export control regulations “while seeking a resolution to the matter on all available fronts and with the support of many of our business partners.” (This version of the story was refiled to correct name of company in 16th paragraph) Reporting by Karen Freifeld in New York and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Sanders & Shri NavaratnamOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

In the letter, ZTE said that once it confirmed the employee bonuses were not reduced and reprimands not completed, it disclosed the information and took “immediate remedial action.”  The order “sends the wrong message” to other companies who may be considering settling with the Commerce Department over export control issues, ZTE said.   It said it was committed to complying with the order and U.S. export control regulations “while seeking a resolution to the matter on all available fronts and with the support of many of our business partners.” (This version of the story was refiled to correct name of company in 16th paragraph) Reporting by Karen Freifeld in New York and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Sanders & Shri NavaratnamOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

FILE PHOTO: A Common myna sits next to the logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart installed on the company's office in Bengaluru, India April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File PhotoBloomberg reported earlier on Friday, citing unidentified sources, that Flipkart’s board had approved a deal to sell a stake of about 75 percent in the company to a group led by U.S. retail giant Walmart for about $15 billion. A third source told Reuters that while Flipkart’s board had “in-principle” approved engaging with Walmart based on the terms of an offer before them, taxation related concerns and a few other issues need to be resolved. The first two sources said Alphabet Inc is also likely to invest in Flipkart alongside Walmart, but terms of the deal may change. Japan’s SoftBank Group, the biggest investor in the Indian firm through its private equity fund, is considering selling its roughly 20 percent stake as part of the deal if the price is right, two other sources said. “SoftBank does not like to be a passive investor,” one of the sources said. Reuters had previously reported Walmart was in advanced talks with Flipkart to acquire a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-based online marketplace at a valuation of at least $18 billion. Flipkart has bought back $350 million worth of shares from its investors as it seeks to convert its Singapore-incorporated company to a private limited firm, in a move that could ease the way in for a new strategic investor, regulatory filings show. Flipkart and Alphabet did not respond to Reuters’ requests seeking comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment. AMAZON OFFER Earlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported Amazon Inc had made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart and that it had also proposed a $2 billion breakup fee to convince Flipkart to discuss its offer. Sources told Reuters that Amazon had shown an interest in buying Flipkart, but said a deal with Walmart was much more likely to go through. Amazon is Flipkart’s biggest rival in India. Amazon’s move to bid for Flipkart may push up valuations of the Indian firm, but engaging with the tech giant could be fraught with risks for Flipkart, said industry insiders and lawyers. Beyond the risk of opening its books for due diligence and exposing sensitive commercial agreements to its biggest rival in India, an Amazon-Flipkart combination could face significant antitrust hurdles, they said. Amazon is currently seeking legal opinion to understand how the country’s antitrust regulator, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), is likely to view any deal with Flipkart, a lawyer and an industry source familiar with the matter told Reuters. A former senior CCI official said e-commerce firms were already giving deep discounts and an Amazon-Flipkart union was likely to be in a position to sway the market their way, but the CCI could be convinced to approve a deal if both firms suggested “innovations or remedies.” “This definitely would be a tricky case and not easy to sail through,” he added. Amazon declined to comment on whether it had bid for Flipkart or was seeking legal opinion for a potential investment in the firm. Flipkart, together with its fashion units Myntra and Jabong, controls nearly 40 percent of India’s online retail market, while Amazon is a close second with a 31 percent share, according to data from research firm Forrester. Both Amazon and Flipkart are pouring billions of dollars into winning shoppers in the fast-growing market that is expected to be worth $200 billion within a decade.

"(Repeats with no changes) * Buffett says Apple’s buybacks make sense * U.S., China see benefits of trade, billionaire says * “Oracle of Omaha” defends Wells Fargo’s leadership By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jonathan Stempel OMAHA, Neb., May 5 (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett has been buying a boatload of Apple Inc shares and on Saturday suggested he would buy even more shares at the right price. At Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s annual shareholder meeting, Buffett credited Apple with developing “extremely sticky” products to which consumers become attached and endorsed Apple’s decision to buy back its own stock, saying it was the technology company’s most productive use of cash. “We would love to see Apple go down in price,” Buffett said. Berkshire is now Apple’s third largest shareholder, behind Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc. “I’m delighted to see them repurchasing shares,” Buffett said, just two days after he revealed having bought 75 million additional Apple shares, and four days after Apple said it may repurchase $100 billion of stock. At the end of 2017, Berkshire had owned 165.3 million shares. “I love the idea of having our 5 percent, or whatever it is, maybe grow to 6 or 7 percent without our laying out a dime.” And Buffett described it as a mistake that he never thought Alphabet Inc’s Google and Amazon.com Inc made sense as investments for Berkshire. Buffett, 87, and his longtime partner and fellow billionaire Charlie Munger, 94, also took pointed questions on China, Wells Fargo & Co, guns, healthcare and their investment choices from shareholders, journalists and analysts at the more-than-six-hour meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The questions also elicited views on politics from the “Oracle of Omaha” and Munger. Buffett said it was unlikely that the United States and China would come to loggerheads on trade and believed the countries would avoid doing “something extremely foolish.” “The United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long time,” Buffett said, and that any tensions should not jeopardize the win-win benefits from trade. “It is just too big and too obvious ... that the benefits are huge and the world is dependent on it in a major way for its progress, that two intelligent countries (would) do something extremely foolish,” he said. “We both may do things that are mildly foolish from time to time.” The Trump administration has drawn a hard line in trade talks with Beijing, demanding a $200 billion cut in the Chinese trade surplus with the United States, sharply lower tariffs and advanced technology subsidies, people familiar with the talks said on Friday. Buffett suggested U.S. President Donald Trump should be an “educator-in-chief” on the invisible benefits of trade. Munger, meanwhile, answered a question on steel tariffs imposed by the White House by acknowledging that U.S. producers are hurting. “Even Donald Trump can be right on some of this stuff,” he said. Asked why Buffett was willing to do business with gun makers, he retorted, “I do not believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.” The billionaire investor said U.S. corporate tax cuts were good for shareholders but cautioned that the long-term effects of economic choices could be hard to gauge. And Buffett predicted “bad endings” for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, and said long-term U.S. government bonds were a terrible investment because inflation would consume their returns. CARDINAL SIN Buffett defended Wells Fargo and its chief executive, Tim Sloan, when asked when Berkshire would ditch the bank, one of its largest common stock holdings. Many shareholders applauded the question. Buffett said the bank had committed the “cardinal sin” of incentivizing employees into “kind of crazy conduct.” U.S. regulators imposed $1 billion of fines last month over lending abuses. But he maintained that the bank was not “inferior,” as an investment or morally, to its main rivals. Berkshire owned $25.2 billion of Wells Fargo stock as of March 31, down 14 percent from year end as a series of scandals weighed on the bank’s reputation. Wells Fargo investors last week gave strong backing to the bank’s directors and executives on Tuesday, indicating confidence in its overhauled leadership to rebound. Buffett addressed his alliance with another banker, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Jamie Dimon, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to tackle healthcare. Buffett said U.S. healthcare costs are a tapeworm on the economy, and he said the venture partners expect to name a chief executive within a couple months. CASH STOCKPILE Buffett faces a challenge investing Berkshire’s more than $108 billion of cash and equivalents, including for acquisitions, saying his “phone is not ringing off the hook with good deals.” Shortly before the meeting, Berkshire ended its more than year-long stretch of falling operating profit, while a new accounting rule caused the conglomerate chaired by Warren Buffett to suffer an overall net loss. Buffett said the net results were not representative of the business. The accounting change required Berkshire to report unrealized losses in its equity portfolio, which totaled $170.5 billion at year end, regardless of whether it planned to sell those stocks. Berkshire’s net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with profit of $4.06 billion a year earlier. But operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose 49 percent to a record $5.29 billion, or about $3,215 per Class A share, higher than the $3,116 per share analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GIDDY SHAREHOLDERS Shareholders have been enthusiastic about Berkshire, which sent out slightly more tickets to this year’s extravaganza than in 2015, when an estimated 42,000 celebrated Buffett’s 50th year at the helm. An even larger audience likely watched online via Yahoo Finance. Outside the convention center, Berkshire shareholders lined up for prime seats in the middle of the night. William Robertson, a Scotland native who fights fires and does forestry work in Switzerland, said he lined up at 11:30 p.m. Friday, 7-1/2 hours before doors opened. This year’s meeting is his third. “It gets me first place in the queue, I think when people go to so much effort it shows Warren how important he is for us,” Robertson said.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) on Monday launched a spinoff of its Android operating system for home appliances and other machines, following mixed results with Android offshoots for cars, smartwatches and televisions. FILE PHOTO: A man walks through light rain in front of the Hey Google booth under construction at the Las Vegas Convention Center in preparation for the 2018 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 8, 2018. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo‘Android Things’, which arrives as Google opens its annual conference for developers, could bring its Google Assistant virtual helper to refrigerators and robots and familiar designs to cash registers and vending machines. “The goal is to enable them to be built faster, cheaper and more secure,” said Venkat Rapaka, a product management director at Google. Android derivatives aim to provide users with a consistent interface across devices, while Google and its business partners benefit from a standard way to distribute their applications. Though Google does not charge hardware manufacturers for Android, it expects to generate a return as consumers use new gadgets to use search, watch videos on YouTube and buy content from its Play Store. The Android operating system powers many of the world’s smartphones and drives consumers to Google’s cash-minting apps. But Google has struggled to extend Android’s dominance into other areas over the last four years, technology and financial analysts said. “If you’re charitable, you say it’s early,” said Richard Kramer of Arete Research. “If you’re not, you say Android is irrelevant outside phones.” Android Automotive is not yet deeply embedded in any cars. Shipments of smartwatches with Google’s Wear OS were outnumbered five-to-one by rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) devices last year, according to research firm IDC. Four times as many smart TV shipments last year had Samsung’s (005930.KS) operating system as Android TV, according to IHS Markit. In each category, Google’s Android system posted less market share last year than manufacturer-customized Android variants, which are less fruitful for Google because they typically are not pre-loaded or compatible with its apps. Android variants thrive in China, where Google does not operate. Google also has been slowed by resistance from carmakers to hand over a key interface, smartwatches from consumer electronics brands that failed to attract mass appeal and TV software that manufacturers found too rigid, analysts said. Google officials said the spinoffs have momentum. Activations of Wear OS devices rose 70 percent late last year compared to the year-earlier period. Android TV activations doubled last year compared to the year before, while vehicles with Android embedded should arrive next year, company officials told Reuters. South Asia and Latin America are bright spots, they said. Android TV had “tremendous traction over the last year” from Asian cable and satellite operators seeking it for set-top boxes, said Google product management director Shalini Govil-Pai. Android Automotive was gaining attention from Indian automakers and from Brazil, said Patrick Brady, a Google engineering vice president. Android Things competes with Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Greengrass system and Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) Windows IoT. Google says it will guarantee three years of free security patches to hardware makers and paid extended options. It is also considering automated security scans of device makers’ apps. Health technology startup Byteflies, an Android Things tester, said it viewed the system’s optional integration with Google’s cloud computing service and the large Android developer community as big advantages.

"NEW YORK/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (WMT.N) said on Wednesday it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, the U.S. retailer’s largest-ever deal as it competes with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in an important growth market. Shares of Walmart fell 3 percent. The company warned it expects the deal to reduce fiscal 2019 earnings by 25-30 cents per share if it closes in the second quarter. It also expects Indian investments to shave 60 cents per share from earnings in fiscal 2020. Walmart’s acquisition opens a new front in its battle with Amazon, which had expressed interest in making a competing offer. Amazon holds about 27 percent of India’s burgeoning e-commerce market, according to Euromonitor, where Walmart only operates 21 cash-and-carry wholesale stores in the country that sell to businesses. The deal probably will not do much to change market share between Flipkart and Amazon in India, said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group. In the fiscal year ended March 31, Flipkart reported sales of $4.6 billion. Flipkart sells consumer goods ranging from soaps to smartphones and clothes, and gives Walmart access to an e-commerce market that could be worth $200 billion a year within a decade, according to Morgan Stanley. Related CoverageSouth Africa's Naspers sells Flipkart stake to Walmart for $2.2 billionFactbox: Walmart notches biggest foreign investment with $16 bln Flipkart dealWalmart expects the deal to help set it up “for growth and profits in the future,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a call with investors. McMillon has led Walmart’s efforts to boost international business. Walmart said Flipkart’s logistics, payments and apparel businesses offer new areas of growth. “It is not so much about succeeding in India for Walmart because that may or may not happen,” said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillan Doolittle. “It is really about grabbing an opportunity after waiting on the sidelines in a growth market for over a decade,” he said. Walmart entered the Indian market in 2007 through a joint venture with a local company, years before Amazon debuted there. That joint venture was called off in 2013 and its presence in India has remained largely static, at least partly due to restrictions around foreign investment in physical retail. FILE PHOTO: The logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart is seen on the company's office in Bengaluru, India April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File PhotoFOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Walmart has renewed its focus on catching up with rivals in key international markets. The company retreated from Britain, selling a controlling stake in its British arm ASDA to J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY.L). Walmart is also trying to offload a majority stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International. International business contributed less than a quarter to the retailer’s total revenue of $500 billion in fiscal 2018. Walmart said it plans to fund the India deal through a combination of newly-issued debt and cash on hand. The investment will include $2 billion of new equity funding. Walmart said it remains in talks with other potential investors to join the funding round. This could lower its stake although Walmart plans to retain majority control. Reuters has reported Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) may buy a roughly 15 percent stake in Flipkart for $3 billion. The remainder will be held by existing shareholders, including Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal, China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK), Tiger Global Management and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), the company said. The Walmart logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe Walmart statement made no reference to the exit of Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal or SoftBank Group (9984.T), which was one of the largest investors in Flipkart through its Vision Fund. Reuters had reported that Bansal and SoftBank would sell their entire stakes. Other investors like Naspers and eBay said they sold their holdings in Flipkart. S&P Global Ratings revised its outlook for Walmart to “negative” from “stable,” citing risk as the retailer spends heavily to expand its online and global reach. Walmart’s long-term corporate credit rating was affirmed at “AA,” S&P said. “Walmart has a very poor track record operating outside North America,” said Steven Roorda, portfolio manager with Minnesota-based Stonebridge Capital Advisors, which invests in retailers. “We will not know for five to 10 years whether this transaction is successful strategically or financially.” Additional reporting by Harry Brumpton and Melissa Fares in New York, Siddharth Cavale, Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru, Swati Bhat and Devidutta Tripathy in Mumbai and Sam Nussey in Tokyo; Editing by David Gregorio and Nick ZieminskiOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Gains were broad and volume was high, with all but the utilities and telecom sectors advancing as investors who had moved to the sidelines in recent days ahead of Trump’s decision returned to the market. “It’s classic ‘buy on the terrible news’,” said Ian Winer, director of trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, referring to the wider market’s rally. “People had gotten way too nervous about this.” Trump’s decision for the United States pull out of the international agreement aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was good news for investors betting on a rise in oil prices.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House will convene a meeting on Thursday on the future of artificial intelligence in U.S. industry with major companies including Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Oracle Corp as well as senior government officials. Intel Corp CEO Brian Krzanich and the chief technical officers of Ford Motor Co and Boeing Co are due to take part, along with executives from Mastercard Inc, Microsoft Corp and Accenture, the White House said on Tuesday. The Pentagon and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Transportation are due to take part in the daylong event that will look at artificial intelligence (AI) innovation and research and development and removing barriers to its application. “AI is quickly transforming every segment of American industry - from applications in precision agriculture and medical diagnostics to advanced manufacturing and autonomous transportation,” the White House said. Other companies taking part include IBM Corp, Bank of America Corp, General Electric Co, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Monsanto Co, Pfizer Inc, Walmart Inc, Whirlpool Corp, CVS Health Corp and United Airlines. Facebook Vice President of AI Jerome Pesenti, Google senior research scientist Greg Corrado and the presidents of California Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University also are set to participate. Dean Garfield, president and chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, called the event “an important step to building collaboration between government and industry.” “The tech sector is committed to ensuring that all Americans reap the benefits of this transformative technology, which has the potential to save lives, improve how we harvest food, transform education and more,” Garfield said. Britain last month announced a 1 billion pound ($1.4 billion) joint investment in the AI industry, while the European Union announced it would boost AI investment by about 70 percent to 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) by 2020.

"A logo of Cisco is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman(Reuters) - Network gear maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) is pulling all online ads from YouTube due to fears of the ads appearing on sensitive content on the platform, Cisco’s chief marketing officer, Karen Walker, said in a blog on Wednesday. The blog, which seemed to have been removed from Cisco’s website on Thursday, said the company would not like its ads to “accidentally end up in the wrong place, such as on a streaming video with sensitive content,” adding that the network gear maker will continue to use YouTube as a platform to share Cisco’s video content. Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O), which owns YouTube, said it has partnered with advertisers to make changes. “We have partnered with advertisers to make significant changes to how we approach monetization on YouTube with stricter policies, better controls and greater transparency. We are committed to continuing this dialogue and getting this right,” a Google spokesperson told Reuters. Cisco's action follows a CNN report cnnmon.ie/2jOhAXZ in April that said ads from over 300 companies, including Cisco, ran on extremist channels on YouTube. The companies may have unknowingly helped finance some of these channels through the advertisements they paid for YouTube, according to the CNN report. Cisco did not respond to a request seeking comment on the blog’s removal from its website. YouTube said in a report released last month that it had deleted about 5 million videos from its platform for content policy violations in last year’s fourth quarter before any viewers saw them.

"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Paresh Dave SAN FRANCISCO, June 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google is drawing thousands of new customers to gyms and salons each month through an appointment-booking tool released last year, Reuters has learned, a quiet step in the company’s transition to the next generation of search. The service, known as Reserve with Google, spares users the phone calls, online searching and form filling typically associated with appointments. Say you want a massage at 5 p.m. someplace within a half-mile of work. Google.com/maps/reserve displays openings at nearby businesses and allows users to book, and even pay, without having to call or visit another website. Google declined to comment on performance of the tool, which it launched last March. But in interviews with Reuters, seven software firms that supply schedule data to Google described the volume as significant, with as much as 75 percent of bookings representing new customers. Consumers like the convenience. Business owners say the tool is putting their names in front of more potential clients. The early results are a good sign for Google’s strategy for search at a time when it is battling technology rivals to guide consumers to shops, products, recipes, music and more. Google wants to do more than supply users with a list of web pages that they must research themselves. The next step is to complete tasks for them and provide direct solutions. Google Assistant - the company’s version of Apple Inc’s Siri or Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa - is a central piece of the effort. Users will be able to make Reserve bookings via voice commands to Google Assistant by later this year, people familiar with the matter said. That is something not yet built into Siri or Alexa. Google says its Assistant will even place robo-calls to businesses to make bookings if a suitable option is not available through Reserve, a feature it showed off in May at Google I/O, the company’s conference for software developers. “There’s a competitive race to be the established consumer brand for appointment booking,” said Marc Woodward, vice president at scheduling software maker Genbook. “But you’re going to need this omniscient understanding of availability” at businesses. Google does not charge users or businesses for Reserve. And it has not told schedule partners how it would make money on the service. But shops may place more advertising with Google if Reserve drives customers through their doors. Or Google could eventually charge businesses transaction fees. CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts in April that completing actions on users’ behalf “obviously...has a commercial impact.” INITIAL RESULTS Dozens of firms peddle booking software that spas, restaurants and other businesses use to accept reservations on their websites. To launch Reserve, Google cut deals with 25 large software suppliers, promising to consolidate and polish the process to increase bookings to the firms’ clients. The arrangement gives Google continuous feeds of schedules from tens of thousands of shops spanning 13 countries. These are mostly health, beauty and restaurant businesses not already covered by booking giants such as Expedia Group Inc , OpenTable Inc and Zocdoc Inc. Google does not pay for the data. The payoff, schedule suppliers say, is that the booking tool makes clients more attractive in Google results. Schedulers declined to provide Reuters with detailed performance and financial information about their results with Reserve, citing nondisclosure agreements with Google. Still, they said Reserve’s monthly growth has won them over. Buenos Aires-based Restorando, which works with restaurants in Latin America, said Google attracted about 15,000 diners who spent about $270,000 in the first few weeks, according to spokesman Frank Martin. TimeTrade, a Tewksbury, Mass.-firm whose clients include beauty chain Sephora, said 75 percent of clients’ Reserve reservations have come from new customers. Another supplier, San Francisco-based MyTime, estimated its figure at 50 percent. About 40 percent of all Google reservations to MyTime clients come after hours, evidence of its advantage over phone bookings, CEO Ethan Anderson said. Vancouver-based fitness entrepreneur Chara Marie, who uses Yocale schedule software and coaches clients on exercise and nutrition, said about one in four new clients a week have come through Reserve in recent months. She is an avid user too, booking about 45 nail, hair and massage appointments in the last year through Reserve. Marie, 29, said she is hooked on the convenience and does not miss playing phone tag. “It allows you to spend more time doing what you want to be doing,” Marie said. To be sure, some business owners have questioned Google diluting customer relationships and capturing data. “Am I losing control of my business a little bit?” said George Mardigian of Reserve bookings to his Oakland, Calif. gym Flex Fitness. “We’re a neighborhood gym, and we want to keep things sort of close to the vest.” The Reserve tool has worked well enough that Google says new partners are coming soon, including schedulers who work with horseback riding tours, magic shows and baby sitters.

The service, known as Reserve with Google, spares users the phone calls, online searching and form filling typically associated with appointments. Say you want a massage at 5 p.m. someplace within a half-mile of work. Google.com/maps/reserve displays openings at nearby businesses and allows users to book, and even pay, without having to call or visit another website. Google declined to comment on performance of the tool, which it launched last March. But in interviews with Reuters, seven software firms that supply schedule data to Google described the volume as significant, with as much as 75 percent of bookings representing new customers. Consumers like the convenience. Business owners say the tool is putting their names in front of more potential clients. The early results are a good sign for Google’s strategy for search at a time when it is battling technology rivals to guide consumers to shops, products, recipes, music and more. Google wants to do more than supply users with a list of web pages that they must research themselves. The next step is to complete tasks for them and provide direct solutions. Google Assistant - the company’s version of Apple Inc’s Siri or Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa - is a central piece of the effort. Users will be able to make Reserve bookings via voice commands to Google Assistant by later this year, people familiar with the matter said. That is something not yet built into Siri or Alexa. Google says its Assistant will even place robo-calls to businesses to make bookings if a suitable option is not available through Reserve, a feature it showed off in May at Google I/O, the company’s conference for software developers. “There’s a competitive race to be the established consumer brand for appointment booking,” said Marc Woodward, vice president at scheduling software maker Genbook. “But you’re going to need this omniscient understanding of availability” at businesses. Google does not charge users or businesses for Reserve. And it has not told schedule partners how it would make money on the service. But shops may place more advertising with Google if Reserve drives customers through their doors. Or Google could eventually charge businesses transaction fees. CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts in April that completing actions on users’ behalf “obviously...has a commercial impact.” INITIAL RESULTS Dozens of firms peddle booking software that spas, restaurants and other businesses use to accept reservations on their websites. To launch Reserve, Google cut deals with 25 large software suppliers, promising to consolidate and polish the process to increase bookings to the firms’ clients. The arrangement gives Google continuous feeds of schedules from tens of thousands of shops spanning 13 countries. These are mostly health, beauty and restaurant businesses not already covered by booking giants such as Expedia Group Inc , OpenTable Inc and Zocdoc Inc.

"A figurine is seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The state of Washington said on Monday it had sued Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google for allegedly violating state campaign finance law by failing to maintain information about who buys election ads. The state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, who posted copies of the lawsuits here://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/Complaint-20180604-Google.pdf on his website, said he was seeking penalties against the companies and an injunction for failing to disclose ad spending in state elections since 2013. Facebook said it looked forward to resolving the lawsuit quickly after it recently introduced tools for people to see who is buying political ads on its social network. A representative for Google could not immediately be reached for comment. Like Facebook, Google has pledged to create an online archive of ads that run on its service. Facebook and Google have faced criticism from lawmakers, users and advocates for campaign finance regulation for their role in selling political ads after Russians allegedly used fake names to buy ads to sway American voters around the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Unlike most U.S. jurisdictions, both Washington state and the city of Seattle have laws dating to the 1970s that require companies that sell advertising, such as radio stations, to disclose who buys political ads. Other states put the burden of disclosure on the buyers themselves. A Seattle official said in February that he thought Facebook was in violation of the city’s law, though Seattle has not sued the company. Ferguson said his office received a citizen complaint in April alleging that Facebook and Google had not provided legally required information on political ads.

"The logo of Google is pictured during the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 25, 2018. REUTERS/Charles PlatiauMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s shareholders, including top executives, voted down several proposals on Wednesday, defeating campaigns to tie pay to diversity goals and to get the Google parent to provide more data about efforts to moderate user-generated content. Alphabet management, which effectively has voting control of the company, had moved against the proposals. Shareholders and employees said Wednesday that a gender pay gap and lack of diversity could make it difficult for the company to hire and retain workers, posing a long-term risk to its ability to innovate. “At Alphabet, diversity and inclusion activities by individual contributors have been met with a disorganized array of responses, including formal reprimand,” Google software engineer Irene Knapp said during the shareholder meeting. “The chilling effect … has impaired company culture.” Eileen Naughton, who leads Google’s HR operations, said the company remains committed to an internal goal to reach “market supply” representation of women and minorities by 2020, which could help bring hiring in line with the diversity of the candidate pool. Reuters reported in March that several hundred employees formed an organized effort asking Google to adopt several measures, including human resources guidelines that specify protections for anyone involved in an internal HR investigation. The shareholder proposals had centered on some of Google’s biggest issues outside of the antitrust scrutiny it is facing at home and abroad. Employees and shareholders have challenged the company to address the persistent underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in the company’s U.S. workforce relative to the national population. Google is fighting multiple lawsuits from ex-employees accusing the tech giant of discriminating against women in pay and promotions. Employees have also demanded that the company do more to promote civil discourse on the company’s internal online message boards. How to combat extremist material on Google’s YouTube video service and other public products has also been a major challenge for the company. Google has tried to quell advertiser unease about advertising on open platforms such as YouTube, and stave off proposed regulations to impose penalties for failure to remove problematic uploads.

"SAN FRANCISCO, June 7 (Reuters) - Google will not allow its artificial intelligence software to be used in weapons or unreasonable surveillance efforts, the Alphabet Inc unit said Thursday in standards for its business decisions in the nascent field. The new restrictions could help Google management defuse months of protest by thousands of employees against the company’s work with the U.S. military to identify objects in drone video. Google will pursue other government contracts including around cybersecurity, military recruitment and search and rescue, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in a blog post Thursday. “We want to be clear that while we are not developing AI for use in weapons, we will continue our work with governments and the military in many other areas,” he said. Breakthroughs in the cost and performance of advanced computers have begun to carry AI from research labs into industries such as defense and health. Google and its big technology rivals have become leading sellers of AI tools, which enable computers to review large datasets to make predictions and identify patterns and anomalies faster than humans could. But the potential of AI systems to pinpoint drone strikes better than military specialists or identify dissidents through mass collection of online communications has sparked concerns among academic ethicists and Google employees. “Taking a clear and consistent stand against the weaponization of its technologies” would help Google demonstrate “its commitment to safeguarding the trust of its international base of customers and users,” Lucy Suchman, a sociology professor at Lancaster University in England, told Reuters ahead of Thursday’s announcement. Google said it would not pursue AI applications intended to cause physical injury, that tie into surveillance “violating internationally accepted norms of human rights,” or that present greater “material risk of harm” than countervailing benefits. Its principles also call for employees as well as customers “to avoid unjust impacts on people,” particularly around race, gender, sexual orientation and political or religious belief. Pichai said Google reserved the right to block applications that violated its principles. A Google official described the principles and recommendations as a template that anyone in the AI community could put into immediate use in their own software. Though Microsoft Corp and other firms released AI guidelines earlier, the industry has followed Google’s efforts closely because of the internal pushback against the drone imagery deal.

"WASHINGTON, June 7 (Reuters) - A U.S. senator on Thursday is seeking responses from Google parent Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc on whether the U.S. companies have any data sharing agreements with Chinese vendors, following a disclosure from Facebook Inc this week. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement he has written letters to the companies for information on data sharing agreements, noting that since 2012 “the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and equipment makers like Huawei and ZTE has been an area of national security concern.” Alphabet has said previously it has strategic partnerships with Chinese mobile device manufacturers, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, and Xiaomi, as well as with Chinese technology platform Tencent. It wasn’t clear if Twitter has a partnership with any Chinese vendors. Alphabet and Twitter did not immediately respond to questions for comment. Facebook acknowledged on Tuesday it has data sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese companies including Huawei, the world’s third-largest smartphone maker, which has come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence agencies on security concerns. That brought a firestorm of criticism from members of Congress, including some who said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg should have disclosed the arrangements in testimony to Congress in April. The social media company said computer maker Lenovo Group and smartphone makers OPPO and TCL Corp were among about 60 companies worldwide that received access to some user data after they signed contracts to re-create Facebook-like experiences for their users. Warner asked Alphabet Chief Executive Larry Page if it had “third party partnerships” with ZTE Corp, Lenovo or TCL and if it conducted audits to ensure that the companies were properly treating consumer data. He asked Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey if it had relationships with Huawei as well as those companies. Members of Congress raised concerns after The New York Times reported on the data-sharing practice on Sunday, saying the data of users’ friends could have been accessed without their explicit consent. Facebook denied that and said the data access was to allow its users to access account features on mobile devices.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoWaymo’s Chief Executive John Krafcik said the company could enter European markets in collaboration with a partner, but did not give any timeframe. “There is an opportunity for us at Waymo to experiment here in Europe, with different products and maybe even with different go-to-market strategies,” Krafcik said at the Automotive News Europe Congress in Turin late on Wednesday. “It’s possible we will take a very different approach here than we would in the U.S.” Company officials had been spending time in Europe to better understand regulatory, policy and other differences with the United States, he said. Waymo will use vehicles made by Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Jaguar Land Rover in its autonomous fleet in the United States, but Krafcik did not signal if either would be potential partners for services in Europe. The company is set to launch its ride-hailing service in certain areas of Phoenix, Arizona in coming months, with plans to subsequently roll out the program more widely in the United States. “The world keeps saying that self-driving cars are coming soon. We are doing this, today, in Phoenix, driving without humans in the front row,” Krafcik said. “Sometimes I feel like the world hasn’t quite reckoned with that thought.” In the United States its service will carry the Waymo brand, but that may not be the case in Europe if it has a partner. “It’s probably safe to say the Waymo brand wouldn’t be as strong as some other existing incumbent brands that are already strong in Europe,” Krafcik said. Large tech companies, established automakers and well-funded startups including Uber Technologies Inc and Tesla Inc are all stepping up efforts to gain pole position in the self-driving cars market, which is expected to carry the automobiles industry into the next era. Fiat Chrysler said last week it would supply Waymo with another 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. The companies are also in early discussions about using Waymo’s technology in FCA cars to be sold in retail. On June 1, Waymo showcased some of the Chrysler vans during FCA’s investor day in Italy, taking participants for test drives. “For the first time we brought Waymo technology and demonstrated true Level 4 (autonomy), no humans in the front row, fully autonomous, no safety-net driving, right here in Italy - it was amazing,” Krafcik said. Waymo said in March it would also add up to 20,000 Jaguar Land Rover electric vehicles to its upcoming autonomous fleet.

The companies are also in early discussions about using Waymo’s technology in FCA cars to be sold in retail. On June 1, Waymo showcased some of the Chrysler vans during FCA’s investor day in Italy, taking participants for test drives. “For the first time we brought Waymo technology and demonstrated true Level 4 (autonomy), no humans in the front row, fully autonomous, no safety-net driving, right here in Italy - it was amazing,” Krafcik said. Waymo said in March it would also add up to 20,000 Jaguar Land Rover electric vehicles to its upcoming autonomous fleet.

"OSLO, June 7 (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund backed activist shareholders’ attempt to force Google parent Alphabet Inc to report openly on global content controversies, voting records showed on Thursday. The vote at the annual meeting of Alphabet shareholders on Wednesday was the fund’s latest push for transparency among Silicon Valley giants. The motion, which ultimately failed, could have forced the company to detail the risks it faces from controversies ranging from fake news to election interference. Norges Bank Investment Management, operator of the world’s largest sovereign fund, last week backed a similar proposal at Facebook to report on “fake news”, and on Tuesday sought to wrest the role of Tesla chairman away from Elon Musk, the carmaker’s CEO. At Alphabet, the fund also supported a motion that would have forced the company to report on gender pay gaps, but stopped short of backing proposals on board diversity and linking sustainability to senior executives’ pay. The Norwegian fund, which owns 1.4 percent of all globally listed shares, held a 0.8 percent stake in Alphabet at the end of 2017, worth $5.86 billion, according to the fund’s own data.

"SHANGHAI/BEIJING, June 12 (Reuters) - Chinese truck drivers are demonstrating against higher fuel costs and the dominance of local truck hire platform Manbang which they said is squeezing incomes, a potential headache for the firm backed by SoftBank Group Corp and Alphabet Inc. Since late last week, demonstrations by truck drivers have been seen in over a dozen locations around China, according to Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin, which tracks labour action in mainland China. On social media, photos and videos circulated showing long lines of parked trucks adorned with banners. The demonstrations come as oil prices hit their highest level since 2014 in recent weeks, scraping $80 per barrel and stoking cost increases for businesses and consumers, especially in large oil-importing nations such as China. The truck drivers also cited a squeeze on haulage rates due to the dominance of Manbang, formally known as Full Truck Alliance Group. Manbang raised $1.9 billion in April from Japan’s Softbank and Alphabet’s venture capital fund CapitalG. The firm is often described as China’s “Uber for trucks”, in reference to U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc . It runs an app that allows companies to connect with truck drivers - often independent contractors - tapping into demand for haulage in one of the world’s busiest markets for goods transport. China Labour Bulletin said that earlier in June, Manbang implemented a policy to prevent registered truck drivers and customers from contacting each other directly, to ensure transactions and haulage rates were set only via the app. Manbang, formed in a merger of haulage platforms Yun Man Man and Huo Che Bang, did not respond to requests for comment. The firm in April said 5.2 million of China’s 7 million freight trucks were members of the Full Truck Alliance Group. Demonstrations were recorded in provinces including Shandong, Sichuan, Chongqing, Anhui, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Hubei, Henan and Zhejiang, the labour monitor said. Banners featured slogans such as “boycott low prices” and “truckers all rise”. There were also messages threatening violence toward truck drivers who did not strike. So far, there have been no reports of any significant impact from the demonstrations. China’s truckers are not alone. On Sunday, drivers in Bosnia blocked roads to demonstrate against rising fuel prices.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - YouTube said on Thursday that video uploaders with more than 100,000 followers could start paid fan clubs on the service, one of several new features aimed at helping itself and its users diversify revenue after a turbulent year. FILE PHOTO: The YouTube app logo is seen on a smartphone in this picture illustration taken September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File PhotoThe unit of Alphabet Inc’s Google said it was investing in reducing reliance on advertisers, who deliver billions of dollars in revenue annually but increasingly do not want to be associated with some content, such as racy music videos and roguish stunts. Some video makers saw earnings fall last year when YouTube placated advertisers by restricting where commercials appear. New tools such as memberships and expanded merchandise sales should give video producers more control over their businesses, said Rohit Dhawan, senior director of product management at YouTube. Dhawan declined to quantify the investment into what YouTube calls “alternative monetization.” But he said that YouTube is keeping $1.50 each month out of every $5 membership to justify resources involved. Alternative monetization is a major topic for YouTube staff as they interact with video creators this week at VidCon, an industry convention in Anaheim, Calif. Facebook also expanded revenue options for videomakers this week. YouTube’s goal is to develop a suite of software for creators to manage fan relationships and envisioned tools, such as a way to send personalized “happy birthday” videos to members, requires large teams, Dhawan said. “The number of engineers we have working on this is not because we think there’s something there,” he said. “We know there’s something here.” Amy Shira Teitel, who posts science videos on YouTube, said she has gained 103 subscribers since starting to test memberships in September. The extra $300 a month has let her expand research, including visiting archives in Washington, D.C. In exchange, she holds members-only conversations online about her forthcoming book. Viewers “know I’m spread pretty thin, and they know if they help me make my work possible, it won’t go away,” Teitel said. Videomakers choose the name of their membership club and the perks offered, all subject to approval by YouTube staff. Members can report creators that fail to deliver on benefits, such as T-shirts or shout-outs. YouTube also said creators can customize merchandise on design service Teespring and sell it in a new section underneath their videos. Teespring is lowering fees as part of the deal, to provide creators an extra $1 in profit per item through 2019 and to pay YouTube a small commission, Dhawan said.

"(Reuters) - German carmaker Audi AG (NSUG.DE) has partnered with autonomous vehicle simulation platform provider Cognata Ltd to speed up the development of autonomous vehicles, the Israel-based startup said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: Audi sign is seen on the show car at the Audi Forum before the company's annual shareholders meeting in Ingolstadt, Germany May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File PhotoCognata said its simulation platform virtually recreates real-world cities, provides a range of testing scenarios, including traffic models that simulate realistic conditions, prior to physical roadway tests of autonomous vehicles. Audi, through its self driving car unit Autonomous Intelligent Driving GmbH (AID), is the first major carmaker to sign a multi-year partnership on Cognata’s platform, which will help it reduce the time to get its autonomous cars to market. “At AID, we are convinced that simulation is a key tool to increase our development speed and a necessary one for the validation of our product and for proving it is safe,” AID Chief Technology Officer Alex Haag said. “After exploring various solutions, we decided that partnering with Cognata is the fastest way to reach these goals,” Haag added. A slew of car and technology companies from U.S. No.1 automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) to Uber [UBER.UL] and Alphabet Inc’s Waymo are investing in testing autonomous capabilities and looking to launch the technology for commercial use soon. “Simulation technology can help greatly reduce autonomous vehicle testing costs for carmakers,” Cognata Chief Executive Officer Danny Atsmon told Reuters. The AID-Cognata deal comes at a time when Israel’s defense technology, which has helped its military drive tanks, guide and intercept missiles, and keep its computer systems secure, is being redeployed in the development of driverless cars. Israeli auto tech startups raised $814 million last year, only slightly behind the $1.2 billion raised by U.S. firms. (reut.rs/2Iqe3cg) U.S. chipmaker Intel (INTC.O), German auto supplier Continental (CONG.DE), Samsung (005930.KS), Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and GM (GM.N) are among companies that have bought startups or are setting up their own development centers in Israel. Cognata, which competes with firms including Redwood City, California-based Metamoto, had raised a total of $5 million as of the last funding round in 2017. The startup’s investors include Maniv Mobility - a car technology fund backed by Jaguar Land Rover (TAMO.NS) and French auto parts maker Valeo (VLOF.PA) - planemaker Airbus’ venture capital fund Airbus Ventures and Tel-Aviv based early-stage venture capital firm Emerge.

"(Reuters) - Bike sharing service Lime said on Monday it raised $335 million from a group of investors including ride-sharing firm Uber Technologies Inc and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). Uber will work with Lime as a strategic partner in the electric scooter space with the companies working to co-brand Lime’s scooters and make the service available on the Uber app. The investment round was led by GV, formerly Google Ventures, and the other new investors included IVP, Atomico and Fidelity Management and Research Company, Lime said in a blog post . The latest investment round values California-based Lime at $1.1 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier on Monday. Bird, Lime’s rival in the electric scooter space, raised $300 million in June in a round led by Sequoia Capital, giving the company a $2 billion valuation. Lime’s existing investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Singapore’s GIC, also participated in the latest funding round. Uber earlier this year agreed to buy electric bicycle service JUMP Bikes and was among the companies applying for a scooter permit in San Francisco in June. Lime, which operates bike and scooter schemes in about 60 cities and university campuses in the United States, has launched operations in the German cities of Berlin and Frankfurt and in Zurich, Switzerland.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google introduced new ad-buying tools on Tuesday that showcase its growing push to allow machines instead of humans to fine-tune ads and determine where they should run. Advertisers have welcomed the advanced software, which could encourage them to spend more on Google as it makes more efficient use of their money. But consumer privacy and technology analysts are watching the shift with concern and a push for more regulatory scrutiny may be coming. In Europe, the month-old General Data Protection Regulation requires end users to consent to being the subject of some forms of automated decision making. The rule also requires transparency about data involved and an effort to prevent bias, though what is covered is likely to be litigated. Google’s new ad services are developed with machine learning, in which software analyzes old sets of starting conditions and end results and then decides how to maximize a certain result based on new, real-time conditions. Google said its machine learning now can predict when to show ads so that given a certain budget, it can maximize foot traffic to stores or favorable consumer sentiment of a brand. It also announced broader availability of a tool that automatically chooses the best text for ads in Google search results from an advertiser-created list of up to 19 phrases. Users making the same query might see different versions of an ad “based on context,” the company said in a blog post on Tuesday as it opens its annual conference for advertisers. Critics fear that machine learning increases risks of discrimination and privacy intrusions in advertising. Machines can learn to prey on vulnerable individuals or withhold offers to people based on sensitive traits such as race. FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S., August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoGoogle does not allow targeting ads to users based on race, but its “algorithms might be doing it by proxy unbeknownst to the company” by relying on other information that approximates race, said Dipayan Ghosh, a Harvard University fellow and former public policy staffer at Facebook Inc. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google’s senior vice president for ads, told Reuters last month that the company has researched “fairness” in machine learning extensively but it is “not a solved problem.” He said Google has begun checking for biases using test data with some algorithms, including one that determines which YouTube videos are suitable for advertising. Balancing privacy with business goals is another focus. Machine learning helps Google more effectively analyze user data to measure store visits and intention to purchase an item. But assessing how advanced systems treat user privacy can be difficult without details on how the decision-making works, said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “Algorithmic transparency is key to accountability,” he said.

FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of laptop and mobile device users are seen next to a screen projection of Google logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File PhotoThe European Commission’s decision, delayed by a week by U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to a NATO summit in Brussels last week, is expected on Wednesday. It comes just over a year after the Commission slapped a landmark 2.4-billion-euro ($2.8 billion) penalty on Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, for favoring its shopping service over those of competitors. The EU penalty is likely to exceed the 2017 fine because of the broader scope of the Android case, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters. The EU sanction comes in the midst of a trade conflict between the United States and the EU, which has hit back against U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum by targeting $3.2 billion in American exports with higher duties. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will meet Trump in Washington D.C. on the trade issue next week. The Android decision is the most important of a trio of antitrust cases against Google. With the company able to make its ads show up in more smartphone apps than any other tech rival, Google’s app network has quietly become a huge growth engine. The company’s high payouts to app developers, coupled with its entrenched relationship with millions of advertisers, has turned Google into the main revenue source for many apps. Its Play Store accounts for more than 90 percent of apps downloaded on Android devices in Europe. Its popularity in turn could mean an uphill battle for EU antitrust regulators seeking to level the playing field for Google’s rivals by ensuring that users can download from competing app stores and that smartphone makers are free to choose pre-installed apps. Regulators say Google has tilted the field in its favor by forcing smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search together with its Play Store and Chrome browser, sign agreements not to sell devices on rival Android systems and also pay smartphone makers to only pre-install Google Search on devices. Google has denied the charges, saying that bundling search with its Google Play allows it to offer the entire package for free, and that smartphone makers and users have a wide choice. Regulatory action is probably too late because of Google’s entrenched position, said analyst Richard Windsor at research company Radio Free Mobile. “Users in the EU are now completely accustomed to using Google services and have come to prefer them,” he said. “Hence, I think separating Google Play from the rest of Google’s Digital Life services would have very little impact as users would simply download and install them from the store,” Windsor said. The Android case was triggered by a 2013 complaint by lobbying group FairSearch whose members at the time included competitors such as Oracle (ORCL.N), Nokia (NOKIA.HE) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

A star performer in the quartet of the so-called FANG stocks that have fueled the market’s gains in recent years, Netflix has surged 106.2 percent year-to-date, leading the S&P 500 and making it one of Wall Street’s most closely-watched stocks.

On a conference call Thursday, Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said he sees technology and FANG companies becoming even more central to Wall Street’s rally as they outcompete traditional consumer corporations. “Tech is going to inherit the earth,” Golub said. “They’re actually delivering much more than everyone else.” Netflix has posted an average gain of about 7 percent the day after each of its previous four quarterly reports. Wall Street’s recovery has been uneven. Six of the S&P’s 11 sectors remain in negative territory for the year, while the S&P 500 is up 4.8 percent, just 2.5 percent short of its January high. The S&P 500 tech index, which led last year with a 37-percent rise, is up more than 15 percent so far this year. The consumer discretionary index, which includes Amazon and Netflix, is up about 14 percent, and sits at No. 2.

S&P 500 companies are expected to post 20.9 percent earnings per share growth for the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Technology earnings are seen rising 25.5 percent, while consumer discretionary profits are seen up 16.1 percent, helped by Amazon.com and Netflix. Stock valuations are more reasonable now than back in January, with the S&P 500 price-to-earnings multiple at 16, roughly its five-year average. It was above 18 in January when stocks began tumbling. The FANGs are far pricier than the wider market, however, with Netflix at 111 times expected earnings, Amazon at 106, Alphabet at 25 and Facebook at 24, which places even greater focus on their earnings and forecasts in the weeks ahead. “These companies would be revalued if, for whatever reason, their earnings or revenue growth really began to wane. But right now, it’s not the case,” said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “They have the kind of top-line growth that is the envy of the rest of the companies in the S&P 500.” Fueled by massive spending on shows like “Altered Carbon” and “O Mecanismo”, Netflix has said it expects to have added 6.2 million new subscribers in the June quarter.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s venture capital unit GV led a $16 million investment this month in Peerspace Inc, a self-serve online booking tool for event spaces, the firms told Reuters on Tuesday. The deal reflects venture capitalists’ continued interest in businesses that bring to the web tasks that once required physical proximity or multiple phone calls, including hailing rides, renting wedding outfits and booking vacation cabins. Peerspace said it has accommodated tens of thousands of events such as corporate meetings, film shoots and bridal showers. About 6,000 locations across nine large U.S. cities have listed on Peerspace, including churches, bookstores and mansions. People often seek hotel ballrooms or well-known sites for events. But Peerspace has a $30-billion opportunity in the United States to promote overlooked and distinctive locations, said Joe Kraus, a general partner at GV who is joining the startup’s board of directors.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s venture capital unit GV led a $16 million investment this month in Peerspace Inc, a self-serve online booking tool for event spaces, the firms told Reuters on Tuesday. The deal reflects venture capitalists’ continued interest in businesses that bring to the web tasks that once required physical proximity or multiple phone calls, including hailing rides, renting wedding outfits and booking vacation cabins. Peerspace said it has accommodated tens of thousands of events such as corporate meetings, film shoots and bridal showers. About 6,000 locations across nine large U.S. cities have listed on Peerspace, including churches, bookstores and mansions. People often seek hotel ballrooms or well-known sites for events.

The euro had nosed higher on solid German manufacturing data and though the dollar was having a largely quiet day there were plenty of jarring moves in emerging markets to raise the pulse rate. Turkey’s lira slid more than 3 percent along with its main stock market after its central bank opted to keep interest rates on hold despite double-digit inflation that would best be tackled via a big rate hike. China’s offshore yuan meanwhile had hit a one-year low and Beijing’s government bond yields had jumped after the cabinet said it would pursue a more vigorous fiscal policy and as traders bet on further easing in monetary conditions. “The big story is that the Chinese currency continues to slide,” said Societe Generale FX strategist Alvin Tan. “It is clear the government is moving towards policies that are supporting growth,” he adding, saying the trend was likely to bring a reaction from the United States in time. For now though the focus in the U.S. remains the banner corporate earnings season. To date, 82 percent of the 90 S&P 500 companies that have posted results had topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts estimate of profit growth have risen to about 22 percent for the second quarter, up from 20.7 percent at the start of the month. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.2 percent, as European bourses continued to shuffle higher. Tech stocks were set to get a boost from Alphabet, the parent of Google, which was up 4.6 percent in premarket trading a record high, valuing the group at around $900 billion. Other FAANG stocks also rose. Facebook climbed 1.9 percent, while Amazon gained 1.4 percent. Twitter gained 0.9 percent. European stocks were also up, partly thanks to some upbeat results from UBS, autos firm PSA and chipmaker AMS, higher metals prices and renewed signs of strength in Germany’s powerful manufacturing sector. But they were also just riding in the slipstream of Asia’s and Wall Street’s overnight gains. Shanghai blue chips had closed up 1.5 percent at a one-month high and Japan’s Nikkei had added 0.5 percent, even though a disappointing reading on factory activity suggested the threat of a trade war was starting to bite. WHO WILL BUY THESE BONDS? Bond bulls were still smarting from speculation that the Bank of Japan is close to scaling back its monetary stimulus, a risk that lifted long-term borrowing costs globally. Markets were worried that Japanese investors would have less incentive to hunt offshore for yield, said ANZ economist Felicity Emmett. “The 10-basis-point steepening in the Japanese yield curve is massive in the context of a market that rarely moves more than 1 basis point,” she said. “It reflects a broader fear that central banks are reducing their purchases while U.S. bond supply is set to rise significantly.” As a result, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hovered around their highest in five weeks at 2.95 percent, and were again nearing the 3 percent mark. Germany’s government bond yields rose to a five-week high of 0.416 percent. Most other euro zone yields were higher by 1-3 basis points. “Global stocks, Asian stocks in particular have seen a boost from (potential) policy-easing measures in China, and this helps the general risk sentiment and adds to some of the headwinds to bond markets,” said Commerzbank strategist Rainer Guntermann. GDP GUESSING GAMES Part of the shift in yields was caused by talk that data on second-quarter U.S. economic growth, due on Friday, would top current forecasts of 4.1 percent. Dealers noted some media reports that President Donald Trump was predicting an outcome of 4.8 percent. That would not be out of bounds, given the widely-watched Atlanta Fed GDP tracker puts growth at an annualised 4.5 percent. Such a strong outcome would only add to the risk of faster rate increases from the Federal Reserve and underpin the dollar. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was barely moved at 94.56 compared with a low of 94.207 on Monday. It bought 111.19 yen, against Monday’s trough of 110.75. The euro stalled to $1.1695, having run into profit-taking at a peak of $1.1750 overnight. Turkey’s lira was still down 3 percent after the inaction from its central bank was seen as a missed chance to get some much-needed credibility. In commodity markets, oil prices were a shade firmer as the focus flicked between oversupply worries and escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. U.S. crude added 24 cents to $68.12. Brent edged up 10 cents to $73.17 a barrel. Spot gold was barely budged at $1,224 an ounce.

Google’s dominance in online advertising has been challenged this year by the antitrust battle over its Android mobile software, which led to a $5 billion fine for the quarter, and other regulatory actions, including new European privacy rules. Government pressure to improve moderation of user-created content has forced Google to hire more analysts. YouTube, a Google-owned streaming service, has increased spending on video content to keep consumers from shifting to offerings from Netflix Inc and expanding media conglomerates such as AT&T Inc. But those issues have yet to halt Alphabet, which has grown quarterly revenue at least 20 percent year-over-year for two straight years. “There was never a question about Google’s dominance of a buoyant digital ads market,” said analyst Richard Kramer of Arete Research. The quarterly growth rate of what the company pays ad partners, called traffic acquisition costs, fell for the first time in three years, which Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell described as the “most impressive” piece of the results. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts that investments in artificial intelligence software meant to better predict where to place ads are making its services more attractive to advertisers. The company is selling more ads as its YouTube video service and Google search grow globally, he said. Profit margins have dipped as more ads get shown on mobile devices, where Apple Inc and other firms charge fees to distribute Google search on their devices and apps. But Google in the second quarter entered the second year of its latest multi-year deal with Apple, which analysts said helped even out costs. Operating margin rose to 24 percent from 22 percent last quarter, excluding the $5 billion antitrust fine issued last week by the European Commission over Google’s anticompetitive licensing of Android software. The margin was down from 26 percent a year ago. Net profit dropped to $3.2 billion from $3.5 billion, due to the fine, but analysts focused on operating results. Adjusted earnings per share were $10.58, excluding the fine and the effects of other investments. Analysts estimated $9.52 per share, according to research aggregated by Thomson Reuters. Some analysts excluded other items as well, and Alphabet also beat that consensus of $9.59. Alphabet’s $32.66 billion in second-quarter revenue, 86 percent of which came from Google’s advertising business, beat an average estimate of $32.17 billion. The rest of the revenue came from Google’s non-advertising businesses, which include selling apps, gadgets and cloud computing services, and ventures such as offering internet service. The newer businesses are sucking up investments as Google adds data centers and employees to support them. But Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts on Monday that the advertising unit is also getting new capital. Alphabet, Facebook Inc and other leading application makers have become big forces in advertising as consumers globally, and in turn, advertisers devote increasing attention to smartphone and TV apps instead of newspapers and traditional TV broadcasts. Pichai said the company had opportunity to show ads on Google Home smart speakers and Google Maps and was slowly determining the best way to do so. A logo is pictured at Google's European Engineering Center in Zurich, Switzerland July 19, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannCompany shares have benefited from easing regulatory concerns. A new privacy law enacted by the EU in May has had a minimal effect on Google’s advertising business, and smartphone industry executives have described the EU antitrust case over Android as too late to matter. The company has cautioned that it is too early to measure the impact on both fronts. But Alphabet’s outlook is tempered by cost concerns, and Amazon.com Inc’s encroachment into advertising has threatened Google’s lucrative deals with media companies and advertisers. Alphabet trails Facebook, Amazon and Twitter Inc in valuation as measured by the ratio of enterprise value to expected earnings. Its enterprise value, or market capitalization and debt minus cash, trades at 13 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, compared with about 14 times for Facebook, 24 times for Twitter and 26 times for Amazon, according to TR data.

Its workers, meanwhile, could earn extra money on top of their hourly pay, which starts at $11 an hour. “Just imagine associates all over the world delivering orders to customers on their way home,” Marc Lore, head of Walmart’s e-commerce operations, said at its annual meeting in June 2017. “That can be a real game-changer.” But months later, Walmart quietly retreated from its original vision for the pilot program - launched in New Jersey and Arkansas - and ended it altogether in January, according to company documents obtained by Reuters and interviews with more than two dozen Walmart employees. The story behind the foundering employee delivery initiative, which has not been reported, offers insight into Walmart’s ongoing attempts to find unconventional ways to close the gap with Amazon in the game of cheap, rapid, doorstep delivery of packages. According to Walmart data, people who shop in stores and become online customers spend nearly twice as much as those who shop at one or the other. Here in New Jersey, Walmart started the program with the idea that store employees could courier all items that would fit in a car. But the initiative failed to gain traction with skeptical employees who had to use their time after work, according to sixteen workers who participated in the trial. Walmart is now testing a more modest service with just four Walmart employees who deliver goods from a single store in Woodstock, Georgia, Reuters has learned. In this latest initiative, Walmart is also overhauling the guidelines for employees and limiting deliveries to groceries and related items such as paper plates. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman confirmed that the retailer ended its first experiment early this year, without elaborating. Walmart is testing a variety of ways to deliver merchandise, she said, and is “encouraged by what we’re seeing” in the Georgia store. Despite having 4,700 U.S. stores within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, Walmart is still trying to figure out how to efficiently make deliveries and has poured billions of dollars into ecommerce in recent years. But as recently as the last holiday season, its online sales disappointed some investors. Walmart caters to U.S. online shoppers by having them drive up to their local store themselves to collect merchandise they ordered online. It also partners with shippers such as FedEx Corp, the United States Postal Service (USPS) for routine deliveries. Still, Walmart aims to be able to deliver groceries to more than 40 percent of households in the country by the end of this year. Globally, Walmart is experimenting with deliveries by motorbike in Mexico and with new small supermarkets in China to make deliveries in 30 minutes or less. In Japan, Walmart is opening a new warehouse to support orders, and expanding its online offerings to include meal kits. Earlier this year, Reuters reported the retailer’s delivery partnerships with Uber and Lyft ended after the ride-hailing services struggled to deliver people and packages together. It continues to rely on third-party companies such as Postmates, Deliv and Doordash to help deliver groceries, and last week partnered with Alphabet Inc’s Waymo. SKEPTICAL DRIVERS Walmart’s associate delivery pilot program in the leafy, middle-class suburb of East Brunswick, New Jersey, started with store managers pitching employees an unusual new way to boost pay. Those who passed background checks could moonlight as drivers for the Walmart.com delivery service, they said. Some staffers, who did not wish to be named fearing retribution for speaking to the media, told Reuters they balked at having to use their own cars and personal insurance policies for a program that would benefit Walmart. To entice them to sign up, Walmart offered free TVs and iPads as gifts, they said. Eventually, about 50 of the store’s more than 150 associates initially signed up, they added, though many had no prior experience as couriers with a delivery service. Walmart declined comment on this. FILE PHOTO: A worker sets up a display of dish washing liquid in prepare for the opening of a Walmart Super Center in Compton, California, U.S., January 10, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoFourteen of the sixteen Walmart employees told Reuters that they were put off by the program’s poor compensation. And all of them expressed concern over who would be responsible if they got into an accident or if merchandise was lost. For example, the East Brunswick Walmart paid store associates $2 per package, with participants making three to five total drop-offs during a typical trip within a ten mile radius, participants told Reuters. It also reimbursed them 54 cents for fuel per mile, over the federal fuel reimbursement rate of 53.5 cents in 2017, and offered them an extra hour of overtime pay. But every employee Reuters spoke to who signed up said they typically lost at least 30 minutes of time, waiting at the store after their shifts ended to collect the items and were never compensated for it. Walmart didn’t offer more than one hour of overtime even if it took more than an hour to deliver orders after finishing their 40 hour work week, former participants said. Walmart disputed this saying it paid workers overtime when they exceeded 40 hours. All sixteen workers who had participated in the program said delivery of five packages would generally take them more than two hours to complete. If a worker drove 10 miles to drop five packages, that would earn them $15.40 in compensation per package and fuel, before overtime pay. Rival Amazon pays independent drivers $18 to $25 an hour for deliveries, and the fuel costs belong to the driver, according to the Amazon Flex website. Amazon declined to comment on the story. One of the Walmart employees said in only one instance did she earn an additional $100 at the end of the week – after making nearly a dozen deliveries. “The money was never worth it... and they stopped paying mileage in the end,” said an employee who did not wish to be named. Twelve out of sixteen employees said they were not paid mileage for the final deliveries they made before the program was shut. Walmart did not comment on mileage payments that employees said were not made. As for insurance, risk and liability for accidents and lost packages, many of the employees Reuters spoke with said they were unclear if Walmart would shoulder the responsibility or not. DOWN TO A TEAM OF FOUR Now, an initiative known internally as ‘Associate Delivery 2.0’ is being run with four employees hired specifically as delivery drivers in Woodstock, Georgia, according to company documents and interviews. To build demand, Walmart will waive the fee for the first delivery order if it is for $50 or more, according to a Walmart promotional pamphlet at the store. For subsequent orders, the retailer’s mobile app offered delivery on a minimum $30 order for a fee of $7.99 to $9.95. The team of three men and one woman, working separately, load up their cars to make deliveries to shoppers within ten miles. Maurice Thomas, who is one of the four Walmart employees, illustrates the retailer’s new tack. A hybrid between a delivery driver and a store employee, Thomas’s role is newly created to revive the initiative, he and other store employees in Georgia said. Thomas took a job at the Woodstock store three years ago unloading trucks. Now he uses his own car, fuel and personal insurance to deliver 6 to 7 packages to shopper’s homes every day. “I have a fixed schedule and doing this is much better than unloading trucks,” said Thomas, who is 28. Walmart pays Thomas $12.50 an hour and reimburses 54.5 cents a mile, comparable to the 54.5 federal fuel reimbursement rate in 2018, he said. If Thomas drove 10 miles within an hour to make deliveries, he would earn $18.30. Thomas said every two weeks he is usually left with about $130-$140 dollars after buying fuel.

Wall Street's optimism about last year's 10th anniversary iPhone, coupled with record share buybacks, have propelled Apple's stock 34 percent higher over the past 12 months, pushing the company's stock market value above $1 trillion on Thursday.   The Cupertino, California company's shares added another 0.4 percent on Friday, putting its market capitalization at $1.005 trillion.  Apple's 12-month gain is far better than the S&P 500's 14 percent increase over the past year, but it pales beside Amazon's astounding 85 percent surge, propelled by the online retailer's scorchingly fast revenue and profit growth.  Amazon is now the second-largest publicly-listed U.S. company, with a market capitalization of $890 billion, followed closely by Alphabet and Microsoft, at $852 billion and $824 billion respectively.  Google-owner Alphabet's stock has risen 31 percent over the past 12 months, and is up 17 percent in 2018.   Together with Facebook, the five largest U.S. companies account for 15 percent of the S&P 500.       Synovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan said he owns shares of Amazon mostly because of its dominance of the cloud computing industry, a business that grew 42 percent in the June quarter and provided most of Amazon's operating profits.   "Of the three companies, I'd say Amazon will get to $1 trillion next," Morgan said.      Average analyst price targets put Apple's stock market value at $1.05 trillion, Amazon at $1.02 trillion, Alphabet at $970 billion and Microsoft at $953 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards. But Amazon's market capitalization would overtake Apple's later in 2018 if both companies shares were to continue their 12-month growth pace.

The tech company’s stock jumped 2.9 percent to end the day at $207.39, giving it a market capitalization of $1.002 trillion. During the session, Apple’s stock market value reached as much as $1.006 trillion. Apple has rallied about 9 percent since Tuesday, when it reported June-quarter results above expectations and said it bought back $20 billion of its own shares. It was Apple’s best two-day run since April 2014. In a memo to Apple’s more than 120,000 employees on Thursday that was seen by Reuters, Chief Executive Tim Cook said the $1 trillion valuation was “a significant milestone” that gave Apple employees “much to be proud of.” But he said it was “not the most important measure” of the company’s success. “Financial returns are simply the result of Apple’s innovation, putting our products and customers first, and always staying true to our values,” Cook said in the memo. Started in the garage of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1976, Apple has pushed its revenue beyond the economic outputs of Portugal, New Zealand and other countries. Along the way, it has changed how consumers connect with one another and how businesses conduct daily commerce. Apple’s stock market value is greater than the combined capitalization of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N). It now accounts for 4 percent of the S&P 500. The Silicon Valley stalwart’s stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S&P 500’s approximately 2,000 percent increase during the same almost four decades. Related CoverageInstant view: Apple hits $1 trillion stock market valuationOne of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy. He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping “Computer” from Apple’s name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Nokia off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value. During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following. Jobs, who died in 2011, was succeeded as chief executive by Tim Cook, who has doubled the company’s profits but struggled to develop a new product to replicate the society-altering success of the iPhone, which has seen sales taper off in recent years. In 2006, the year before the iPhone launch, Apple generated less than $20 billion in sales and net profit just shy of $2 billion. By last year, its sales had grown more than 11-fold to $229 billion - the fourth highest in the S&P 500 .SPX - and net income had mushroomed at twice that rate to $48.4 billion, making it the most profitable publicly listed U.S. company. ‘STILL SEE UPSIDE’ Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina, has included Apple in his clients’ portfolios for about a decade. Recently, some of his older clients have bought Apple shares for their grandchildren. “We still see upside from it, and as new money gets deposited we continue to buy, preferably on the dip,” Carbone said.

REUTERS/Mike SegarApple’s stock has risen over 30 percent in the past year, fueled by optimism about the iPhone X, launched a decade after the original. Also propelling Apple higher in recent months was Apple’s announcement that it earmarked $100 billion for a new share repurchase program. In its report on Tuesday, Apple sales led by the iPhone X, which sells for about $1,000, pushed quarterly results far beyond Wall Street targets, with subscriptions from App Store, Apple Music and iCloud services bolstering business. “The markets are starting to recognize the value of its platform and services more and more, and that’s what is being reflected in the increase in market capitalization,” said Brad Neuman, director of Market Strategy at Alger, a growth equity asset management firm in New York City. Even with its $1,000,000,000,000 stock market value, many analysts do not view Apple’s shares as expensive. Shares of Apple this week traded at about 15 times expected earnings, compared with Amazon at 82 times earnings and Microsoft at 25 times earnings. Adjusting for four stock splits over the years, Apple debuted on the stock market for the equivalent of 39 cents a share on Dec. 12, 1980, compared with Thursday’s high of $208.38. In 2015, Apple joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of capitalism’s most exclusive clubs. Since 1980, IBM Corp (IBM.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), General Electric Co (GE.N) and Microsoft have also alternated as the largest publicly listed U.S. company. In 2007, Chinese government-controlled PetroChina (601857.SS) briefly reached a stock market value of about $1.1 trillion following its public listing in Shanghai. It is now worth about $200 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. One of five U.S. companies since the 1980s to take a turn as Wall Street’s largest company by market capitalization, Apple could lose its lead to the likes of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) or Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) if it does not find a major new product or service as global demand for smartphones loses steam. Hot on Apple’s heels is Amazon.com, the second-largest listed U.S. company by market value, at around $880 billion, closely followed by Google-owner Alphabet and by Microsoft.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s second-largest e-commerce firm, JD.com Inc, said it is shifting management of its warehousing assets to a separate unit, in a move it hopes will revive profits after it swung back to a loss in April-June. A sign of China's e-commerce company JD.com is seen at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) Asia 2018 in Shanghai, China June 14, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song JD.com, which counts Tencent Holdings Ltd, Walmart Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google as investors, has been in and out of the red for the past year and on Thursday reported a second-quarter net loss of $334.4 million. That was nearly double forecasts for a $177 million loss in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of 18 analysts and reflected increased investments and slower sales. In a call with analysts on Thursday, executives said that they expect the new unit, which will oversee warehouse sales and warehouse management services, to help offset hefty technology investments as the company battles Alibaba Group Holding Ltd for market share. JD.com currently owns roughly 2.5 million square meters of warehouse space, part of it acquired in recent years on beneficial terms with local governments that are looking to boost job creation and which will soon start to yield returns. “(These) initiatives are yet to provide meaningful financial results but we believe we’ve made good traction since doubling down on technology last year,” JD.com’s Chief Financial Officer Sidney Huang said. “We expect the monetization of our logistic properties, when realized, will compensate part or all of the additional investments,” Huang said. Huang said that some, but not all, of the revenue from the new unit would become visible in the company’s financials within six to 12 months. JD.com’s shares were up nearly 1 percent on New York’s Nasdaq on Thursday but are down more than 20 percent since the start of the year. The drop echoes extended slides by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com investor Tencent Holdings Ltd, amid analyst concerns over the health of Chinese tech stocks. SOFT SALES JD.com’s sales volumes are historically higher in the second quarter due to the company’s mid-year shopping festival ‘618’, an 18-day event, but profits took a hit this year when sales dropped unexpectedly toward the end of the festival, executives said. JD.com reported sales of 159 billion yuan during 618, up 33 percent from a year earlier but lower than analysts expected due to crossovers with national holidays. “In the last 10 days of June we started to observe a softness in our sales growth, but we’ve seen recovery in August,” said Huang. Executives have blamed unfair competitive tactics by market leader Alibaba for harming JD.com’s clothing sales and creating a “ripple effect” that negatively affects other categories. Alibaba has previously denied its strategies are unfair. JD.com forecast revenue growth for the third quarter of between 25-30 percent, skewing lower than an average estimate of 29.8 percent in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll. The company reported a 31.2 percent rise in revenue to 122.3 billion yuan for the quarter ended June 30, marginally below an average estimate of 122.7 billion yuan from 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Courtesy of Kroger/Handout via REUTERS(Reuters) - U.S. supermarket operator Kroger Co (KR.N) said it will start testing driverless grocery delivery on Thursday with technology partner Nuro at a single Fry’s Food Store in Scottsdale, Arizona. Kroger and rival Walmart Inc (WMT.N) each have teamed up with autonomous vehicle companies in a bid to lower the high-cost of “last-mile” deliveries to customer doorsteps, as online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN.O) rolls out free Whole Foods delivery for subscribers to its Prime perks program. “Kroger wants to bring more customers the convenience of affordable grocery delivery,” said Kroger Chief Digital Officer Yael Cosset, who added that the test will also gauge consumer demand for the service. The first phase of the test will use a fleet of Toyota Prius cars equipped with Nuro technology. Those cars have seats for humans who can override autonomous systems in the event of an error or emergency. Nuro’s R1 driverless delivery van, which has no seats, will begin testing this autumn, the companies said. “While we compete final certification and testing of the R1, the Prius will be delivering groceries and helping us improve the overall service,” a Nuro spokeswoman said. Self-driving car delivery from the Fry’s store will cost $5.95 with no minimum order. It is only available at addresses within the store’s zip code of 85257, Kroger said. Walmart and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) self-driving car company Waymo are partnering to test a service that shuttles Phoenix shoppers to stores to collect online grocery orders.

Morgan Stanley raised its price targets on Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet to become the most bullish Wall Street brokerage on the high-flying stocks and causing their shares to rise 2.7 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. The technology sector rose 0.88 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, as Alphabet gained. Apple hit a record high and was last up 0.9 percent. The consumer discretionary index jumped 1.02 percent, as Amazon’s gains more than offset a drop in retailers. Amazon’s stock hit a record high and moved closer to following Apple into the $1 trillion market cap club. “We’re definitely seeing some of the previous market leaders heading the markets today,” said Brant Houston, managing director of CIBC Private Wealth Management in Denver, Colorado. “It’s definitely a risk-on environment and investors are clearly bullish with some of the advancement in trade negotiations along with strong economic growth numbers.” There were signs that Ottawa was open to taking a more conciliatory approach in talks with Washington to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement, after the U.S. and Mexico struck a deal on Monday. U.S. economic growth was a bit stronger than initially thought in the second quarter, notching its best performance in nearly four years, Commerce Department data showed, as businesses spent more on software and imports fell. At 12:48 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 80.93 points, or 0.31 percent, at 26,144.95, the S&P 500 was up 16.44 points, or 0.57 percent, at 2,913.96 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 68.92 points, or 0.86 percent, at 8,098.95. Among other leading sectors were materials and energy which added 0.89 percent and 0.85 percent, respectively, as metal and oil prices rose. Sportswear retailer Dick’s Sporting fell 3.6 percent on weak sales that it partly blamed on low demand for products from Under Armour, pushing its shares down 0.7 percent. American Eagle Outfitters slid 6.5 percent after missing profit estimates due to higher wages and advertising to support the expansion of its popular Aerie line of lingerie. Apparel retailers and department store chains led the decliners on the S&P, but the S&P retail index was up 1.33 percent on Amazon’s strength. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.07-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.63-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 57 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 96 new highs and 14 new lows.

Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet, becoming the most bullish Wall Street brokerage on the so-called FANG members, causing the stocks to rise by 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent. The technology sector rose 0.92 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, on gains in Alphabet. Apple hit a record high and was last up 1.0 percent. The consumer discretionary index was up 0.70 percent, as Amazon’s gains more than offset a drop in retailers.

Also helping sentiment was Commerce Department data that showed second-quarter U.S. economic growth was a bit stronger than initially thought, notching its best performance in nearly four years as businesses spent more on software and imports fell. After striking a deal with Mexico on Monday, the United States is in trade talks with Canada to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement amid signs Ottawa was open to taking a more conciliatory approach. Also on the trade radar is an upcoming Sept. 5 deadline for public comment on a U.S. proposal to slap tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. “The theme of the day is the trade talk with Canada which is a big step, although the elephant in the room is still China. That’s what has the most weight on concerns with the market moving forward,” said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada. “There’s definitely room to run in the equity markets with more records being hit, especially with the momentum on trade.” At 11:25 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 70.42 points, or 0.27 percent, at 26,134.44, the S&P 500 was up 14.65 points, or 0.51 percent, at 2,912.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 63.17 points, or 0.79 percent, at 8,093.21. Dick’s Sporting Goods tumbled 5.5 percent as the sportswear retailer’s quarterly same-store sales fell more than expected. The company blamed tighter controls on gun sales and weak sales of Under Armour products, which pushed shares of the sportswear maker down nearly 1 percent. In a weak day for retailers, department store chains Macy’s , Kohl’s and Nordstrom fell more than 2 percent while Tiffany’s dropped 4.9 percent. Hewlett Packard Enterprise was up 3.1 percent after the IT products and services provider topped revenue and profit estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.66-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch on Thursday asked the Federal Trade Commission to rekindle an antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc’s Google, and President Donald Trump vowed to fight what he called political censorship by social media companies. FILE PHOTO: Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Orrin Hatch (R-UT) speaks at the start of the House-Senate Conferees conference meeting on the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 13, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File PhotoHatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons recounting several news reports that identified complaints about Google’s anticompetitive conduct and privacy practices. Alphabet shares were little changed after the release of the letter. The company declined to comment. Trump, speaking at a campaign-style rally in Evansville, Indiana, said his administration was standing up for free-speech rights and warned that large social media companies could not be allowed to “control what we can and cannot see.” “You look at Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants and I made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged search results,” Trump said. “We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices,” he added, noting that “it can go the other way some day too.” Lawmakers from both major parties and Google’s rivals have said this year they see an opening for increased regulation of large technology companies under the FTC’s new slate of commissioners. Google’s critics say that ongoing European antitrust action against the web search leader and this year’s data privacy scandal involving Facebook Inc and political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica demonstrate their concerns about the unchecked power of the tech heavyweights. About 90 percent of search engine queries in the United States flow through Google. Facebook and Twitter executives are expected to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Sept. 5 about their efforts to deter foreign campaigns from spreading misinformation online ahead November’s midterm elections. Lawmakers have criticized Alphabet for not scheduling a top executive, such as Chief Executive Larry Page, for the hearings. In 2013, the FTC closed a lengthy investigation of Google after finding insufficient evidence that consumers were harmed by how the company displayed search results from rivals. Trump accused Google’s search engine on Tuesday of promoting negative news articles and hiding “fair media” coverage of him. Trump’s economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later said the White House was “taking a look” at Google, and that the administration would do “some investigation and some analysis,” without providing further details. Earlier this year, Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat, and Representative Todd Rokita, a Republican, sent separate letters asking the FTC to probe Google. Simon, the new Republican chairman of the FTC, said in July the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. An FTC representative was not immediately available for comment. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past the brand logo of Alphabet Inc's Google outside its office in Beijing, China, August 8, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File PhotoHatch, at event hosted by reviews website and Google rival Yelp Inc in May, said moves made by “an entrenched monopolist” deserve extra skepticism. “They may well be used, not to further consumer welfare, but to foreclose competitors,” he said, according to prepared remarks. Yelp, a local-search service, said in a statement that Hatch’s letter was “heartening to see” as it underscored the bipartisan plea for FTC scrutiny of Google.

"SAN FRANCISCO/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Google retains only a slight lead over Facebook in the competition for digital ad dollars in the crucial India market, sources familiar with the figures say, even though the search giant has been in the country far longer and has avoided the controversies that have dogged its rival. Facebook’s success has shaken Alphabet Inc’s Google, led by an Indian-born CEO, Sundar Pichai, who has made developing markets a priority. Google officials in India earlier this year were alarmed to learn that Facebook Inc was likely to generate about $980 million in revenue in the country in 2018, according to one of the sources. Google’s India revenues reached $1 billion only last year. Facebook and Google declined to comment on Indian revenue figures or the competition between the two companies. Google is now pushing back, attempting to lure customers with better ad-buying tools and more localized services. The revamped strategy mirrors initiatives that have succeeded in boosting the time Indian consumers spend with Google services. The battle in India reflects an epic challenge for Google in developing markets around the world that are crucial to the company’s long-term growth - many consumers in those country’s are gravitating to Facebook and it’s siblings, Instagram and WhatsApp, at the expense of Google search and YouTube, and advertising dollars are quick to follow. “Facebook is a far more user-friendly platform even though they haven’t created features specifically for Indian advertisers,” said Vikas Chawla, who runs a small ad-buying agency in India. Facebook ads, compared with those on Google search or YouTube, tend to transcend language barriers more easily because they rely more on visual elements, said Narayan Murthy Ivaturi, vice president at FreakOut Pte Ltd, a Singapore-headquartered digital marketing firm. Pinpointing younger consumers and rural populations is easier with Facebook and its Instagram app, he and other ad buyers said. And Facebook is succeeding in India, which boasts the fastest-growing digital ad market of any major economy, despite internal turmoil and political controversy. It has been without a country head for the last year, and has faced a series of incidents in which rumors circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp have prompted mob violence. Facebook and Google between them took 68 percent of India’s digital ad market last year, according to advertising buyer Magna. Media agency GroupM estimates digital advertising spending will grow 30 percent in India this year. The Facebook phenomenon is evident close to home for Google. During a recent lunch period, six out of 10 people who walked out of Google’s Bangalore offices while looking at their phones told Reuters they were checking WhatsApp. All 10 said they regularly used Whatsapp. Eight Indian ad buyers interviewed by Reuters were divided on whether Facebook would overtake Google in Indian ad revenue. That such a question would even be debated explains why Pichai, Google’s chief executive, has pressed to flip the company’s approach to emerging markets.

Shortly after taking the helm three years ago, Pichai mapped a new strategy for places such as India: More services tailored to locals; more marketing on radio, billboards and TV; more local staff and start-up investment. Google’s India workforce has more than doubled since to more than 4,000 employees, or about eight times Facebook’s presence, according to a tally of LinkedIn profiles and company statements.

They will also testify on “how they plan to address new requirements from the European Union and California, and what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation,” Thune said. Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue, fueled by massive breaches that have compromised the personal information of millions of U.S. internet and social media users, as well as breaches involving large retailers and credit reporting agency Equifax Inc. Separately, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a tweet late on Tuesday that Google “claims to be fair, but gave a ‘silent donation’ to a left-wing group to stop Trump” and “works w/ China/Russia to censor the internet, but canceled a contract with our military.” He noted Google declined to take part in a Senate Intelligence hearing last week that featured Twitter and Facebook. “It’s time for @Google to answer some ?’s An invite will be on its way,” McCarthy wrote. Google said in a statement on Wednesday that the “suggestion that Google’s products or actions are politically biased is simply wrong.” The company said it “will continue to ensure that our products and election efforts remain strictly non-partisan in nature.” The Internet Association, which represents more than 40 major internet and technology companies, said on Tuesday it backed modernizing U.S. data privacy rules but wants a national approach that would pre-empt new regulations in California that take effect in 2020. The witnesses at the Sept. 26 Senate hearing include Google’s chief privacy officer, Twitter’s global data protection officer and Apple’s vice president for software technology. The White House said in July it was working to develop consumer data privacy policies and officials have held more than 50 meetings with major firms and other groups as the Trump administration seeks to help the policies become enshrined in legislation eventually. California Governor Jerry Brown signed data privacy legislation in June aimed at giving consumers more control over how companies collect and manage their personal information, although it was not as stringent as new rules in Europe. Under the law, large companies would be required starting in 2020 to let consumers view the data they have collected on them, request deletion of data, and opt out of having the data sold to third parties. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation took effect in May, replacing the bloc’s patchwork of rules dating back to 1995. Breaking privacy laws can result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros ($23.2 million), whichever is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros.

"(Repeats to additional subscribers, text unchanged) By Ginger Gibson WASHINGTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - After months of waging a behind-the-scenes war against President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs that have escalated far beyond what business groups once imagined, more than 60 U.S. industry groups are launching a coalition on Wednesday to take the fight public. Emergence of the group, Americans for Free Trade, comes after Trump has warmed to the use of tariffs, implementing billions of dollars worth in an effort to use them as a threat to win concessions or in the belief they will create U.S. jobs. “A lot of other interest groups thought they wouldn’t go this long or go this deep, but the layering effect (of tariffs) has finally gotten everyone to say: ‘Enough is enough,’” said Nicole Vasilaros, the top lobbyist for the National Marine Manufacturers Association, whose members are weighing laying off workers after seeing costs rise as much as 35 percent. Trump has imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, mostly industrial machinery and intermediate electronics parts such as semiconductors. A pending $200 billion list would extend further into consumer goods, and the threat of an additional $267 billion would basically cover every Chinese export to the United States. China has threatened retaliation, which could include action against U.S. companies operating there. Washington has demanded that Beijing better protect American intellectual property, cut its U.S. trade surplus, allow U.S. companies greater access to its markets and roll back its high-technology industrial subsidy programs. The business coalition includes groups representing some of the nation’s largest companies. Among them, the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the largest refiners like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, and the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents companies like Target Corp and Autozone Inc. “There has been a lot of work that has been going on over the last eight months to try to persuade the president and the administration that tariffs are not going to work. Our view is that it’s not too late,” said Dean Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Microsoft Corp, Google owner Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc. While Trump threatened tariffs on the campaign trail and ended America’s participation in the Trans Pacific Partnership, a large multinational trade pact, few observers took his threat seriously. Trump has since demonstrated he is serious on tariffs, ramping up the attacks on China, threatening car import levies and pushing for a more pro-American North American Free Trade Agreement, even at the risk of killing the three-country pact. RETAIL LEAD The coalition grew out of weekly meetings featuring industries organized by the National Retail Federation (NRF), whose members include Amazon.com, Macy’s Inc and Walmart Inc. “This is almost every sector of the American economy involved,” said David French, the top lobbyist for the NRF. The group will target Republican members of Congress in five states - Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana and Tennessee. While not engaging in electioneering ahead of Nov. 6 elections where control of Congress is at stake, it will urge constituents to discuss the trade issue with lawmakers. The group plans to expand that effort to a dozen states by the end of the year.

"WASHINGTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - After months of waging a behind-the-scenes war against President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs that have escalated far beyond what business groups once imagined, more than 60 U.S. industry groups are launching a coalition on Wednesday to take the fight public. Emergence of the group, Americans for Free Trade, comes after Trump has warmed to the use of tariffs, implementing billions of dollars worth in an effort to use them as a threat to win concessions or in the belief they will create U.S. jobs. “A lot of other interest groups thought they wouldn’t go this long or go this deep, but the layering effect (of tariffs) has finally gotten everyone to say: ‘Enough is enough,’” said Nicole Vasilaros, the top lobbyist for the National Marine Manufacturers Association, whose members are weighing laying off workers after seeing costs rise as much as 35 percent. Trump has imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, mostly industrial machinery and intermediate electronics parts such as semiconductors. A pending $200 billion list would extend further into consumer goods, and the threat of an additional $267 billion would basically cover every Chinese export to the United States. China has threatened retaliation, which could include action against U.S. companies operating there. Washington has demanded that Beijing better protect American intellectual property, cut its U.S. trade surplus, allow U.S. companies greater access to its markets and roll back its high-technology industrial subsidy programs. The business coalition includes groups representing some of the nation’s largest companies. Among them, the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the largest refiners like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, and the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents companies like Target Corp and Autozone Inc. “There has been a lot of work that has been going on over the last eight months to try to persuade the president and the administration that tariffs are not going to work. Our view is that it’s not too late,” said Dean Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Microsoft Corp, Google owner Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc. While Trump threatened tariffs on the campaign trail and ended America’s participation in the Trans Pacific Partnership, a large multinational trade pact, few observers took his threat seriously. Trump has since demonstrated he is serious on tariffs, ramping up the attacks on China, threatening car import levies and pushing for a more pro-American North American Free Trade Agreement, even at the risk of killing the three-country pact. RETAIL LEAD The coalition grew out of weekly meetings featuring industries organized by the National Retail Federation (NRF), whose members include Amazon.com, Macy’s Inc and Walmart Inc. “This is almost every sector of the American economy involved,” said David French, the top lobbyist for the NRF. The group will target Republican members of Congress in five states - Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana and Tennessee. While not engaging in electioneering ahead of Nov. 6 elections where control of Congress is at stake, it will urge constituents to discuss the trade issue with lawmakers. The group plans to expand that effort to a dozen states by the end of the year.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the meeting after President Donald Trump criticized social media outlets, alleging unfair treatment of conservatives.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Representative Greg Walden, chair of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a hearing earlier this month that Twitter had made “mistakes” that, he said, minimized Republicans’ presence on the social media site, a practice conservatives have labeled “shadow banning.” At the hearing, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said some of the platform’s algorithms had not been impartial and that the algorithm had been changed to fix the issue. Publicly at least, state attorneys general have not given much support to the idea that they might investigate social media companies because of concerns over political bias. A handful of states said they planned to attend the meeting. Of those, the Texas attorney general’s office said it would send a representative because of concerns about conservative ideas “being suppressed on several social media platforms,” Marc Rylander, a spokesman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, said in an emailed statement.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A reshuffling of Wall Street benchmark industry sectors that transferred high-flying FANG stocks like Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) out of the technology label may be a boon to some under-the-radar companies that used to compete with them for investor attention. FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 20, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoCompanies such as Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N), Xerox Corp (XRX.N), Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM.O), and Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) that do not often grab headlines could be among the unexpected winners from the largest reclassification of companies on Wall Street since 1999, fund managers say. That is because fund managers who are looking for technology exposure may be willing to add positions in companies that they previously overlooked now that Alphabet and Facebook have been regrouped into the new communications services sector and are no longer an option. “At the end of the day, there are a lot of investors who are very sector-aware,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York. “If you’re a smaller tech company, this is great because you no longer have to compete against Google for capital.” The overhaul by S&P Dow Jones Indices of the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) took effect on Monday. The changes are meant to reflect how the tech, media and consumer industries have evolved. Maintained by S&P and MSCI since 1999 and widely used by portfolio managers, the taxonomy classifies companies across 11 sectors. The communication services sector will include three out of the four so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Alphabet - even though investors widely consider them the leaders of the tech rally that powered the stock market higher in recent years. While Alphabet and Facebook will leave technology, Netflix will be moved out of consumer discretionary to join the renamed sector. Amazon.com will stay put in consumer discretionary. Shares of Alphabet, which made up approximately 10.2 percent of the technology sector, are up 12.3 percent for the year to date. After Apple, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Visa Inc (V.N), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Cisco now round out the S&P tech index’s largest five components. Overall, the regrouping of companies in new sectors is expected to generate more than $30 billion in market activity as active investors and passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recalibrate their positions to reflect the new weightings, according to estimates from State Street. While most diversified fund managers have wide leeway in deciding what companies to own, most tend to hug the weightings of the S&P 500 sectors when constructing their portfolios. That means that if a fund manager used to own Alphabet as a way to gain technology exposure, he or she would need to find another company to fill that hole now that Alphabet is in another sector. PLAYING DEFENSE The shuffling of benchmark sectors may also make it harder for investors to play defense during the next market sell-off. Former value-stock companies like AT&T Inc (T.N) that were in the telecommunications sector are now lumped together with growth-focused companies like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) in the communications services sector. “In times when you would want to play defense and allocate to telecom, you can’t really do that anymore,” said Cliff Hodge, director of investments for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Cornerstone Wealth. Approximately 61 percent of the new communications sector will be growth stocks - so named because investors are often willing to pay a higher multiple in anticipation of above-market growth rates - while 100 percent of the former telecommunications sector were value stocks, the name given to companies that have slower growth rates but better dividends and balance sheets, according to State Street Advisors. The former telecom sector traded at a forward price to earnings ratio of 10.6, nearly half of the 19.3 P/E of the new communications sector. FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 21, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoThe sector paid a dividend yield of 5.45 percent, making it an attractive place for investors to hide during market downturns. Yet the sector, renamed communication services, now includes stocks like Netflix, which doesn’t pay a dividend at all. With the telecom sector gone, more investors will gravitate toward consumer staples and utilities sectors, which have become a popular - and expensive - place for dividend income, said Jeffrey Liguori, chief investment officer at Providence, Rhode Island-based Napatree Capital. “Verizon is not a telephone company anymore and neither is AT&T,” he said. “They should be trading like media companies and getting valuations that are more appropriate as well.” Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Jennifer Ablan, Megan Davies and Nick ZieminskiOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Last Friday, a person familiar with the discussions said the Justice Department was considering delaying the meeting. The Justice Department had previously said it had invited a bipartisan group of 24 state attorneys general to attend the Sept. 25 meeting. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said that he worries about suppression of conservative ideas on Facebook, Twitter and other social media.

Some of the state officials attending the meeting or sending representatives have also expressed concern about how Google uses consumer data. Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood filed a lawsuit against Google in January 2017, accusing the company of misusing data collected from public school students who use the company’s software. That lawsuit is pending. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, meanwhile, opened an investigation in November 2017 into whether Google’s data collection practices violate consumer protection laws. Hawley is also probing whether Google violated antitrust law by manipulating search results to favor its own products. Google said at the time of the probe being opened that it had “strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment.” Reporting by Jan Wolfe; editing by Lisa Shumaker and Rosalba O'BrienOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo Attorney General Jeff Sessions led the discussion with attorneys general or other representatives from 13 states and the District of Columbia, the department said. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson said after the meeting, which lasted about an hour, that much of the discussion focused on whether concerns about collection of consumer data can be addressed using antitrust law. The group made no immediate plans to file a case or open any investigation, Becerra said. The discussion had been expected to focus on companies like Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Google owner Alphabet Inc, which have been accused by some conservatives of seeking to exclude their ideas. Hood said that a “minute” portion of the meeting was focused on the issue of potential, online political bias. Peterson said talks among the federal and state law enforcers were “at the initial stage,” and had been triggered by a presentation about collection of consumer data which was given at a June meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General. Hood, whose office has already sued Google, said that he would like to see private, consumer information treated like intellectual property. Becerra said that much of the discussion focused on grappling with how best to use a slow-adapting legal system to address issues related to data use, sale and collection, most of which is invisible to the ordinary consumer. “There are growing concerns that the sector is moving into spaces that most people couldn’t have thought of or imagined and trying to understand what that means. And so whether or not there is a definition within our current legal architecture that fits or embraces what is going on these days is part of the question,” said Becerra. The meeting, first announced on Sept. 5, was called by Sessions to discuss whether social media companies have intentionally stifled “the free exchange of ideas.” Becerra said he expects a larger group of state attorneys general to address the issue at an upcoming meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General. Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said his organization would monitor the group. “Efforts to use governmental power to pressure or even extort companies to adjust their operations to support parochial partisan positions would be an abuse of power and must be resisted,” he said. Consumer data is a powerful tool that companies use to decide where to place advertisements, what content to feature, and which consumers might be interested in the product. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivers remarks to the Office of Justice Programs' National Institute of Justice Opioid Research Summit in Washington, U.S., September 25, 2018. REUTERS/Al DragoThe easiest step would be for antitrust agencies to consider opposing mergers of companies that combine large caches of consumer data if that data can enhance market power, such as Apple’s acquisition of the music recognition app Shazam, said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute. Moss also noted that mergers that combine data processing capability, which relies increasingly on artificial intelligence, could also enhance the market power of already powerful companies in a way that could violate antitrust law. “Data and data processing can absolutely be a strategic asset that can be enhanced by a merger (and) can be used by a dominant firm to exclude rivals,” she said.

"LONDON (Reuters) - London’s High Court on Monday blocked an attempt to bring legal action against Alphabet Inc’s Google over claims it had collected sensitive data from more than 4 million iPhone users although it said the company’s actions had been “wrongful”. FILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured at Google's European Engineering Center in Zurich, Switzerland July 19, 2018 REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoThe claimants had said Google (GOOGL.O) had illegally accessed details of iPhone users’ internet browsing data by bypassing privacy settings on the Safari browser between June 2011 and February 2012. Richard Lloyd, a consumer activist who was behind the “Google You Owe Us” court challenge, had estimated that about 4.5 million people had been affected by the “Safari Workaround” and wanted the tech giant to pay out several hundred dollars in damages to each affected individual. Google had argued the mass case brought by Lloyd, the only named claimant, was not appropriate and should not proceed. “There is no dispute that it is arguable that Google’s alleged role in the collection, collation, and use of data obtained via the Safari Workaround was wrongful, and a breach of duty,” the judge, Mark Warby, said in his ruling. However, he said the case brought by Lloyd did not support the contention that he and those he represented had suffered “damage” as specified by Britain’s Data Protection Act nor could the court allow such representative action to go ahead. In his ruling, he said the main beneficiaries of the claim would have been those who funded it and the lawyers. POSSIBLE APPEAL Lloyd said his group, to which 20,000 people had signed up to, would seek permission to appeal the decision. “Today’s judgment is extremely disappointing and effectively leaves millions of people without any practical way to seek redress and compensation when their personal data has been misused,” he said in a statement. “Google’s business model is based on using personal data to target adverts to consumers and they must ask permission before using this data. The court accepted that people did not give permission in this case yet slammed the door shut on holding Google to account.” A Google spokeswoman said: “The privacy and security of our users is extremely important to us. This claim is without merit, and we’re pleased the Court has dismissed it.” Google remains under pressure from lawmakers and regulators over its privacy practices in the United States, where it has acknowledged making mistakes in the past. In 2012, it agreed to pay a then-record civil penalty of $22.5 million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it misrepresented to Apple Safari Internet browser users that it would not place tracking “cookies” or serve them targeted ads.

The issue was discovered and patched in March as part of a review of how Google shares data with other applications, Google said in a blog post. No developer exploited the vulnerability or misused data, the review found. Shares of its parent company Alphabet closed down 1 percent at $1155.92 following the latest in a run of privacy issues to hit big U.S. tech companies. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Google opted not to disclose the security issue due to fears of regulatory scrutiny, citing unnamed sources and a memo prepared by Google’s legal and policy staff for senior executives. Google feared disclosure would invite comparison to Facebook Inc’s leak of user information to data firm Cambridge Analytica, the Journal reported, adding that Chief Executive Sundar Pichai had been briefed on the issue. Google declined to comment beyond its blog post. Google said on Monday none of the thresholds it requires to disclose a breach were met after reviewing the type of data involved, whether it could identify the users to inform, establish any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take to protect themselves. Security and privacy experts and financial analysts questioned the decision. “Users have the right to be notified if their information could have been compromised,” said Jacob Lehmann, managing director at consulting and accounting firm Friedman CyZen. “This is a direct result of the scrutiny that Facebook dealt with regarding the Cambridge Analytica scandal.” FACEBOOK CHALLENGER Google+ launched in 2011 as the advertising giant grew more concerned about competition from Facebook, which could pinpoint ads to users based on data they had shared about their friends, likes and online activity. Google+ copied Facebook with status updates and news feeds and let people organize their groups of friends into what it calls “circles.” But Google+ and the company’s other experiments with social media struggled to win over users because of complicated features and privacy mishaps. Facebook introduced a feature that allowed users to connect their accounts with their profiles on dating, music and other apps. Google followed suit, letting outside developers access some Google+ data with users’ permission. The bug disclosed on Monday, introduced in a software update, exposed private data including name, email address, occupation, gender and age, Google said. It could not definitely say how many users were affected because it said it keeps only two weeks of such records. Google+ will remain an internal networking option for organizations that buy Google’s G Suite, a bundle of apps for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations. Google’s plan to withdraw the free version of Google+, scheduled for August, could help strengthen its case to U.S. policymakers and regulators that it is different from Facebook, which has faced political heat over allegations that data belonging to 87 million of its users was improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Google refused to send Pichai to a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Sept. 5, where Facebook’s chief operating officer and Twitter Inc’s chief executive testified. An empty chair was left for Google after the committee rejected Google’s top lawyer as a witness. Several policies Google introduced on Monday are designed to curb the data accessible to developers offering mobile apps on the Google Play store or add-on apps for sending and organizing Gmail messages.

Gmail add-ons available to consumers starting next year will be barred from selling user data and be subject to a third-party security assessment that will cost them about $15,000 to $75,000, Google said. Such moves could strengthen Google by making it harder for competing services to grow off its data, said Chris Messina, a designer who worked on Google+ before leaving in 2013. “In 2011, you wanted casual, scrappy developers creating apps, and now it is going to require a professional class that is serious.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google on Tuesday unveiled the third edition of its Pixel smartphone, a Google Home smart speaker with a display and its first tablet computer as it makes a come-from-behind push into hardware. The Google Pixel 3 third generation smartphones are seen on display after a news conference in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 9, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon StapletonThe company’s Android software has gone from being an also-ran to the brains of most of the world’s smartphones and Google topped Amazon.com Inc in smart speaker sales in recent quarters. Pixel phones, though, have been a tougher sell, launching with glitches and garnering less than 1 percent of the global market by shipments in Google’s first two years of trying, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. The Pixel 3, priced at $799, and a larger Pixel 3 XL, priced at $899, mark Google’s latest entries for a phone lineup it hopes will someday be as popular as Apple Inc’s iPhone. The Pixel Slate tablet runs Google’s beefier Chrome OS laptop operating system rather than Android. It is priced at $599, aimed at competing with Apple’s iPad Pro. Shares of Alphabet barely moved on the announcements. Financial analysts said it is difficult to evaluate Google’s hardware business as it is overshadowed by profits from search ads. Google branched into hardware three years ago so that, like Apple, it could have full control of the performance of its applications and the revenue they generate. Other phone makers sometimes crowd out Google’s apps with their own or take a share of ad revenue, hurting Alphabet’s profits. Expanding geographic distribution should provide a small boost to the Pixel line-up. The Pixel 3 will launch in 10 countries, up from six for the Pixel 2 a year ago. New additions include France, Ireland, Japan and Taiwan. The Slate is available in the United States, the U.K. and Canada. A new artificial intelligence tool sure to generate buzz among consumers also could be helpful. The software, launching on U.S. Pixels only, answers calls, requests information about the nature of the calls and shares it as text with the recipient. “We’ve built the first phone that can answer the phone,” Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president for hardware, told media on Tuesday. Ryan Reith, who leads device research at tech consulting firm IDC, said Google did not change enough in the Pixel 3 for it to stand apart from more well-known competitors. “Some of the stuff they are doing with software and artificial intelligence is certainly leading edge,” he said. “But as a lot of the technology advancements become more naked to the eye, it becomes that much tougher to sell.” Google shipped 2.53 million Pixel 2 and 2 XL devices through the nine months ended June 30, Strategy Analytics said. The first Pixel devices hit 2.4 million shipments in the nine months ended June 30, 2017, the firm said. Limited adoption has reflected Google’s hesitancy to go as wide and big in distributing and marketing the Pixel as Apple, which launched its last two iPhone line-ups in about 50 countries. Going from a small experiment to a polished product that works in various languages and is backed by large sales, support and technical teams has been part of Google’s challenge. Last year’s Pixel 2 arrived with bugs that prompted user complaints about unwanted noises during calls, a crashing camera app and an unexpected screen tint. In response, Google doubled warranties to two years. The Pixel 3 faces continued limited sales in the United States since Google again signed an exclusive distribution deal with wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc that means the device will get little marketing from other carriers. Google said it would augment distribution by opening two temporary stores in popular neighborhoods of Chicago and New York on Oct. 18 and putting up displays at U.S. tech retailer B8ta and Goop. Google’s new smart speaker, which has a display to show visual responses to voice commands, mostly matches offerings from Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc. Unlike its competitors, Google said its Home Hub, priced at $149, does not have a video conferencing camera. Home Hub is launching in the United States, the U.K. and Australia. The nod to privacy concerns comes as Google and other big U.S. tech companies try to bounce back from recent data breach scandals. Slideshow (13 Images)Amazon shipped 21.5 million smart speakers, including those with displays, in the year ended June 30, compared with 18.3 million for Google, according to research firm Canalys. Google said in a blog post on Tuesday that it recently delivered some Google Home speakers within 10 minutes of ordering using drones from Alphabet’s Wing. Shares of speaker maker Sonos Inc were down 5.6 percent on Tuesday.

"* Licensing fee comes after record $5 bln EU antitrust fine * Smartphone makers free to use rival versions of Android * Changes come into force on Oct. 29 in Europe By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giant Google will charge smartphone makers a licensing fee for using its popular Google Play app store and also allow them to use rival versions of its Android mobile operating system to comply with an EU antitrust order. Google, an Alphabet subsidiary, announced the changes on Tuesday, three months after the European Commission handed it a landmark 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) fine for using its popular Android mobile operating system to hinder rivals. The company said the licensing fees will offset revenue lost as a result of its compliance efforts. “Since the pre-installation of Google Search and Chrome together with our other apps helped us fund the development and free distribution of Android, we will introduce a new paid licensing agreement for smartphones and tablets shipped into the EEA,” Hiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president for platforms and ecosystems, said in a blog. The European Economic Area (EEA) comprises the 28 EU countries, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Manufacturers taking on Google Play and other Google services such as Gmail, YouTube and maps, can also install the Google Search app and the Chrome browser free of charge. “Android partners wishing to distribute Google apps may also build non-compatible, or forked, smartphones and tablets for the EEA,” Lockheimer said. The changes will apply on Oct. 29 for all new smartphones and tablets sold in the EEA. EU antitrust enforcers in their July decision said Google’s anti-competitive behaviour, which dated to 2011, included forcing smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser together with its Google Play app store on their Android devices. Another illegal tactic included paying manufacturers to pre-install only Google Search and preventing them from using rival Android systems.

"SHANGHAI, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com Inc said on Thursday it was launching a parcel delivery business, a move which could help the firm leverage its network of warehouses and drivers to bolster flagging profits. The shift pits JD.com into greater competition with major rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Cainiao network, as well as dedicated domestic parcel delivery firms such as ZTO Express and YTO Express Group Co Ltd. China’s second-largest e-commerce firm, which counts Tencent Holdings Ltd, Walmart Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google as investors, has been looking to squeeze more from its extensive warehousing assets to boost growth. The firm - which prides itself on owning and controlling its own logistics network - posted a second-quarter net loss of $334.4 million, steeply below what analysts had expected amid rising investment costs and slowing sales. “This marks the next step in leveraging the nationwide logistics network that JD has built over the past decade,” Zhenhui Wang, CEO of JD Logistics, said in a statement posted on JD.com’s website. “JD.com is known throughout China for the fastest and most reliable delivery, and we are confident that users will appreciate the convenience of this new service.” JD.com said the new service would allow businesses and individuals in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to send parcels to locations around China, using the firm’s app to schedule a pick-up by one of the company’s staff. The firm “aims to eventually make residential and business deliveries for shippers from anywhere to anywhere within mainland China in the future”, it added in the statement. China’s express delivery market was worth around 976 billion yuan ($140.7 billion) last year, the State Post Bureau said in January, 32 percent up versus 2016. Delivery firms dispatched about 40 billion parcels last year.

"10-19-2018"	"Wall St Week Ahead-With market on edge, investors look to tech trio "	"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-weekahead/wall-st-week-ahead-with-market-on-edge-investors-look-to-tech-trio-idUSL2N1WX1C7"	"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 19 The pressure is on for Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft as they prepare to report quarterly results at a time when confidence in those market leaders looks increasingly fragile and in danger of derailing Wall Street's rally."	"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The pressure is on for Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft as they prepare to report quarterly results at a time when confidence in those market leaders looks increasingly fragile and in danger of derailing Wall Street’s rally. After worries about higher interest rates sparked a steep sell-off in early October and again on Thursday, the S&P 500 remains down 5 percent from its Sept. 20 record high close, with top-shelf stocks including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) showing little of their vitality from recent years. A quarterly report from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Wednesday after the bell, followed by Alphabet and Amazon late on Thursday, will influence sentiment across Wall Street. “The equity market is at a critical point here,” said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager, Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “In order for it not to get a lot worse, I think you need to see Amazon and Alphabet put up some good numbers.” With investors worried about increased internet regulation and criticism of Facebook’s handling of user data, the social media company’s stock has slumped 29 percent from its record high on July 25. Alphabet is 15 percent below its July 26 record high close, while Amazon has fallen 12 percent this month. Microsoft has also stalled after doubling over the past two years. Still, Netflix and Amazon remain up 81 percent and 51 percent year to date, respectively, underscoring their places among Wall Street’s crème de la crème. The S&P 500’s largest component, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has gained 28 percent in 2018, even after falling 7 percent from its record high on Oct. 3. A 5 percent surge in Netflix on Wednesday after its upbeat quarterly report allayed fears the video streaming company was losing steam. But that did little to perk up its fellow stocks in the so-called FANG group that also includes Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook. In the past, those stocks have often risen together. Powerful rallies by Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Netflix in recent years have made them must-own stocks for portfolio managers, making their ownership so widespread that they are at risk of a major sell-off should a majority of investors’ views about them change for the worse. “So many funds are invested in the same stocks. They got less crowded in the past week, but at this point it’s difficult to say if we are going to shrug everything off and go to new highs a month from now, or if we’re going to test more lows,” warned Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. The recent slide has left Amazon and Facebook trading at discounted multiples of their expected earnings. Amazon’s forward price-to-earnings ratio last week touched 74, a seven-year low, according to Refinitiv data. Facebook this month traded as little as 18 times expected earnings, the lowest since its 2012 public listing. ROBUST EARNINGS GROWTH Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. But some investors are already eyeing slower growth in 2019, when the corporate tax cut benefits will be a year old and no longer create an extra boost. Investors are also nervous about potential fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade conflict with Beijing, and higher interest rates as the strong U.S. economy and low unemployment pressure prices. Propelled by its cloud computing business, Amazon is expected by analysts to report a September-quarter non-GAAP net profit of $1.54 billion, or $3.12 per share, compared to just $256 million a year ago, according to Refinitiv. Alphabet’s September-quarter non-GAAP net profit is seen rising 9 percent to $7.36 billion, or $10.43 per share.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMicrosoft’s non-GAAP net income is seen rising 13 percent to $7.46 billion, or 96 cents per share. Facebook reports its quarterly results on Oct. 30, followed on Nov. 1 by Apple. Amazon and Alphabet are widely considered technology companies. However, within S&P Dow Jones Indices’ Global Industry Classification Standard, Amazon falls into the consumer discretionary sector and Alphabet belongs to the recently renamed communication services sector.

"(Reuters) - Cloudflare Inc, a U.S. startup whose software makes websites load faster and with greater security, is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) that could value it at more than $3.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of CloudFlare, speaks at the Wall Street Journal Digital conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S. October 17, 2017. REUTERS/Mike BlakeThe San Francisco, California-based company is looking to go public in the first half of next year, the sources said this week, joining a string of software and internet firms seeking to tap the stock market and capitalize on strong investor appetite and rich valuations. The IPO will be led by investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. Exact timing of the IPO has not been finalized, the sources added. Cloudflare did not respond to requests for comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Despite a recent pullback in the major indexes of public equity markets, such as the S&P 500, technology firms are increasingly ramping up efforts to tap those markets while interest rates remain low and valuations of private companies are relatively high. Reuters reported last week that CrowdStrike, a security software firm, had also hired Goldman Sachs to lead an IPO that could value it at more than $3 billion. Ride-sharing platform Lyft Inc is also working with investment banks to explore a public offering next year, Reuters has reported. Founded in 2009, Cloudflare provides cloud-based Web services that help improve user experience on websites through actions such as making videos load faster. It also protects against cyber attacks, among other services. The company runs a so-called content delivery network that competes against services from Akamai Technologies Inc and offerings from Alphabet Inc’s Google and Amazon.com Inc’s cloud computing units. Its clients include companies such as Zendesk Inc and Cisco Systems Inc. It serves a total of 10 million website domains and the average Internet user touches its services around 500 times per day, according to its website. In 2015, Cloudflare raised $110 million from investors including Fidelity, Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Inc, Baidu Inc and Qualcomm Inc.

The broad S&P 500 has fallen approximately 4.8 percent over the same time. “Right now we’re certainly looking at a test of the past (market) leadership and some of these FANG stocks have gotten ahead of themselves,” said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager of the Plumb Equity fund, who recently added a position in Square Inc (SQ.N). “We’re looking with companies that have high recurring revenue and high growth, and not a lot of companies are in a better spot than the payments space.” Fund managers from firms including Villere & Co, Plumb Funds, and Ave Maria Mutual Funds said they have moved out of the FANG group of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Alphabet that had led the market this year during the recent volatility because valuations did not appear sustainable. The fund managers said they see the payments sector as a way to tap into growth in e-commerce and mobile computing at a more attractive multiple than FANGs. Amazon trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 160.6, for example, while Visa trades at a P/E of 38.3. “You’re getting a lot of the same disruption  but at a fraction of the price,” said Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at New Orleans-based Villere & Co, who has positions in Visa and transaction processing company Euronet Worldwide Inc (EEFT.O). Euronet shares are up 33.9 percent for the year. Visa and MasterCard in particular are a way to tap into the growth of e-commerce without directly owning online sellers like Amazon, said Brian Milligan, portfolio manager of the Ave Maria Growth fund. Online sales are expected to make up 17 percent of all U.S. retail sales by 2022, up from 12.7 percent in 2017, according to Forrester Research. “They are benefiting from the same secular growth as Amazon, but they are a duopoly,” Milligan said. Investors have also been moving into payment-focused exchange-traded funds. The ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (IPAY.P), a $491 million exchange-traded fund that has PayPal, Visa and American Express Co (AXP.N) among its largest holdings, has had positive inflows for all but one week since U.S. stock market volatility started rising in early September, according to Lipper data. The FANG-heavy Investo QQQ ETF, meanwhile, has posted outflows for 4 out of the past 6 weeks, according to Lipper.

The tech company’s third-quarter results fanned investor concern that big investments in new businesses, increasing regulatory scrutiny and emerging competition are producing slow and unpredictable returns. Alphabet disclosed, for example, that passengers of its self-driving Waymo minivans are now paying for rides, but the offering remains limited to the Phoenix, Arizona region and Waymo’s finances are not broken out. Overall revenue rose 21 percent to $33.74 billion, missing analysts’ estimate by about $310 million, according to Refinitiv data. Google ad sales contributed 86 percent of revenue, but growth slowed to 20 percent from nearly 24 percent last quarter. “Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.” The company attributed much of the slower revenue growth to unfavorable currency exchange rates. Lower ad pricing to contend with antitrust concerns, new privacy rules in Europe and increased competition from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) may have played a role too, financial analysts said. Non-advertising revenue, such as from sales of mobile apps and cloud computing services, also came in slightly below expectations. Those results combined with rising expenses brought down the company’s operating margin to 25 percent from 28 percent a year ago. After falling as low $1028.77, Shares of Alphabet were down about 3 percent to $1,071.01 after hours from their close at $1103.59. Alphabet reported net profit of $9.2 billion, or $13.06 per share, compared with $6.7 billion, or $9.57 per share in the year-ago quarter. That beat the average analyst estimate of $10.45. Earnings were boosted by a lower tax rate and favorable valuation of the firm’s investments in startups such as Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]. NEW BUSINESSES Alphabet has committed to providing cloud computing services and selling hardware over the last few years. It has also ventured into areas where commercial opportunities are nascent, including regions such as India and Nigeria and businesses such as self-driving cars. The Waymo operation in Phoenix is in the early stages of testing pricing, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a conference call on Thursday, noting that some employers were sponsoring workers’ rides. Priming Alphabet’s newer ventures has been costly in terms of marketing and hiring, with about 5,300 employees added in the third quarter. Alphabet’s cost of revenue was $14.3 billion in the third quarter, up 28 percent from a year ago. Capital expenditures soared to $5.3 billion from $3.5 billion last year, with 20 data center sites in development, Porat said. Google has posted strong revenue growth for several years as retailers flock to buy product image ads on Google’s search engine and commercials on YouTube. But Google’s cost structure has been disrupted by surges in usage of its services on smartphones, where the company splits ad revenue with technology makers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and smart speakers, where ads do not appear.

Alphabet gained 5.8 percent this year before Thursday and traded at 24 times expected earnings over the next year.

"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) forecast holiday season sales and profit that missed Wall Street targets on Thursday, projecting revenue growth that would be the slowest in years, sending shares of the world’s largest online retailer down 8 percent in after-hours trade. Amazon’s third-quarter sales lagged estimates as well. Analysts said international results were disappointing and online competition was increasing. The company blamed accounting changes and cautioned that it was being conservative with its outlook. For years, Amazon has made expensive bets on new technology and programs, like its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 to storm the U.S. grocery industry. That has resulted in rollercoaster profits in the past, but revenue has largely grown at a breakneck pace as consumers shifted shopping online and away from brick-and-mortar stores. “Weak revenue growth stuck out like a sore thumb,” said George Salmon, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “And when you’re trading on 70 times expected earnings, it doesn’t take much to jolt the share price.” Amazon’s more subdued expectations for this year’s holiday shopping season, which runs from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday in late November through New Year’s, was a particular surprise. It forecast that fourth-quarter sales will rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, or up to $72.5 billion, while analysts were expecting $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data. That would be Amazon’s lowest quarterly sales growth since at least the start of 2016. In the last four quarters, sales increased between 29 percent and 43 percent. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, said no fundamentals had changed, just some holiday timing in India and accounting differences. “We’re expecting a strong holiday season, so there’s no message in our forward guidance against that,” he said on a conference call with media. “We have everything ready to roll.” The company moved the recording of $300 million in Prime subscription revenue from the fourth quarter to earlier periods in the year, he said. In addition, Amazon faces a tougher year-over-year comparison because the Whole Foods deal closed in the third quarter of 2017, and the different timing of the holiday Diwali affected sales patterns, he said. “Amazon saw a meaningful slowdown in their international division. They had been hitting on all cylinders so this is something investors weren’t ready for,” Chaim Siegel, analyst at Elazar Advisors, said. Amazon forecast fourth-quarter operating income between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion, below the $3.87 billion expected by analysts, according to FactSet. Packages go on an automated conveyor line to be scanned, weighed and labeled at the Amazon fulfillment center in Kent, Washington, U.S., October 24, 2018. REUTERS/Lindsey WassonNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said the results reflected a shifting landscape with retailers holding their own against Amazon. “Others are now getting better at nibbling away at its dominance,” he said, citing Walmart (WMT.N), Target TFT.N and Macy’s (M.N). PROFITS AND THIRD-PARTY GOODS Despite slower sales growth, Amazon has steadily become more profitable. Third-quarter net income rose to $2.88 billion, or $5.75 per share, from $256 million, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier. Up to 53 percent of goods sold on Amazon now come from third-party merchants, the company said on Thursday, marking a steady shift away from traditional retail where Amazon is the seller of a product. That means the company is collecting less revenue but taking in a lucrative cut of others’ sales - all the more profitable when merchants pay Amazon to handle their shipping. Seller services grew 31 percent to $10.4 billion in the third quarter. “They’re indifferent if they sell us their own merchandise or third-party merchandise, so they shouldn’t be punished for the latter,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. More sellers are looking to Amazon to market their products, too - another highly profitable business. Amazon appeals to advertisers because individuals generally are using the site to shop, unlike users browsing Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, the ads sales leader, to find general information or rival Facebook Inc (FB.O) to see updates from their friends. Amazon said revenue from the category and some other items grew 122 percent to $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Olsavsky, the CFO, also said the company is operating more efficiently, hiring less than in the past and adding less warehousing space. Slideshow (7 Images)“We’ve really been able to cut back in a number of key areas,” Olsavsky told reporters, citing cost improvements for cloud unit Amazon Web Services as well. The world’s No.1 cloud business by revenue saw sales up 45.7 percent to $6.68 billion, narrowly edging past estimates of $6.67 billion.

The third-quarter results were the second time running that billionaire Jeff Bezos’ firm had fallen short of sales targets and, allied to a similar disappointment from Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O), they sent a shockwave through stock markets. There were no ratings downgrades from the Wall Street analysts who have almost universally backed the companies’ long-term prospects but several said there were signs that both were beginning to face tougher competition from tech peers as well as the retail companies Amazon has bullied in recent years. The fall of as much as 9 percent in shares knocked more than $80 billion off Amazon’s market value and relegated it behind Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in terms of market value. Now that the Seattle-based firm has devoured retail players like Borders, Sears and Toys ‘R’ Us, it is facing bigger challenges from multinationals who are making substantial investments to compete, D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Thomas Forte said. “Google, Microsoft, and Walmart ... are more difficult to kill,” he said. Shares in Alphabet dropped about 2 percent after it fell short on sales after beating estimates for the past eight quarters. Revenue from Amazon’s international business, which brings in 27.5 percent of total sales, was at the heart of the shortfall in results, growth halving to 13.4 percent compared to the previous quarter.

Its operating profit forecast of between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion also came in below consensus estimates.

Data earlier in the day showed the U.S. economy continued to grow at a healthy pace, offering some support. U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory investment. While economic growth is healthy despite trade wars, the same cannot be said of U.S. corporate profit growth, with disappointing forecasts this earnings season showing how tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs as well as jitters over geopolitical events are hurting companies. The latest came last night from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc, two stocks that have helped power the equity markets decade-long bull run. Google-parent Alphabet’s revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that regulatory scrutiny and competition would throttle its scorching pace of growth. The stock recovered from an earlier drop of as much as 5.6 percent to trade down 3.2 percent. Amazon tumbled 8.2 percent after it missed quarterly sales estimates and gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast. Some investors saw the selloff as a buying opportunity. “It’s been a very controlled selloff,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. While he expects further downside in the market, Paulsen said many investors are looking for chances to buy. “Most people I would argue are sitting around talking about where do we buy. They look at this still more as a buying opportunity than a risk.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 333.12 points, or 1.33 percent, to 24,651.43, the S&P 500 lost 52.84 points, or 1.95 percent, to 2,652.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 168.79 points, or 2.31 percent, to 7,149.55. The S&P 500 was on course for its worst month in more than nine-and-a-half years and at the day’s low was on pace to confirm it was in correction territory, a level when an index closes 10 percent or more below its all-time closing high. The Nasdaq confirmed a correction earlier this week. Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Netflix Inc , the other members of the so-called FAANG group, were also down. While indexes pared their gains, investors still worried about more near-term volatility, particularly ahead of the Nov. 6 U.S. midterm congressional elections. “If you’re not a short-term buyer, why not wait?” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.97-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 87 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 12 new highs and 298 new lows.

U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory investment. While economic growth is healthy despite trade wars, the same cannot be said of U.S. corporate profit growth, with a slew of disappointing forecasts this earnings season showing how tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs as well as jitters over geopolitical events are hurting companies. The latest and, perhaps the most high-profile, came last night from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc, two stocks that have helped power the equity markets decade-long bull run. Google-parent Alphabet’s revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that regulatory scrutiny and competition would throttle its scorching pace of growth. But the stock recovered from a drop of as much as 5.6 percent to trade down 0.5 percent. Amazon tumbled 6.7 percent after it missed quarterly sales estimates and gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast. Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Netflix Inc , the other members of the so-called FAANG group, were down between 0.5 percent and 2 percent. “It’s a classic correction. When markets have gone up as much as they have, people start selling what they own and they are selling it primarily because it’s going down and not because the fundamentals have deteriorated that much,” Tom Plumb, chief investment officer of the Plumb Funds and manager of the Plumb Balanced Fund in Madison, Wisconsin, said. “I think the two potential catalysts for a sharp recovery are the mid-term elections getting behind us and any positive developments between China and the United States.” At 13:00 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 148.10 points, or 0.59 percent, at 24,836.45, the S&P 500 was down 23.46 points, or 0.87 percent, at 2,682.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 71.42 points, or 0.98 percent, at 7,246.92. Despite the pullback on Friday, the three indexes are on track for their worst month in years, with the Nasdaq in correction territory. The indexes hit record highs between Aug. 30 and Oct. 3. The S&P is on course for its worst month in more than nine-and-a-half years and at the day’s low was on pace to confirm it was in correction territory, a level when an index closes 10 percent or more below its all-time closing high. One stock that shone through the day was Intel Corp , last up 4.4 percent after its better-than-expected quarterly results. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.12-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.71-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and 86 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded eight new highs and 285 new lows.

The Nasdaq tumbled nearly 3 percent. The Dow sank 1.7 percent and the S&P 2.3 percent, with the S&P’s session low taking it more than 10 percent below its Sept. 20 all-time closing high. If it closes at these levels, this would confirm a correction. While the U.S. economy continues to grow, despite trade wars, the same cannot be said of U.S. corporate profit growth, with a slew of disappointing forecasts this earnings season showing how tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs, as well as jitters over geopolitical events are hitting companies. The latest and, perhaps the most high-profile, came last night from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc, two stocks that have helped power the equity markets decade-long bull run. Amazon tumbled 8.7 percent after it missed quarterly sales estimates and gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast, sparking a 3.07-percent plunge in the S&P consumer discretionary sector. Google-parent Alphabet sank 4 percent after its revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that regulatory scrutiny and competition would throttle its scorching pace of growth. That triggered a drop in other members of the so-called FAANG group. Facebook Inc fell 3.9 percent, Apple Inc slid 2.1 percent and Netflix Inc dropped 5 percent. Apple led the S&P technology index down 2.64 percent, while the communication services sector, home to the rest of the FAANGs, dropped 3.07 percent. “Expectations were really high going in to Google and Amazon’s earnings. Investors were looking at their earnings to maybe prop up the market and get us out of this correction that we’ve been in,” said Paul Brigandi, managing director and head of trading at Direxion in New York. “The correction was initially driven by interest rates and tariffs, so people were looking forward to earnings season to get us out of the downward trend we’re in.” The selloff got some respite from data showing U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory investment. “Even though the GDP numbers were good, they only gave a temporary relief to the markets,” said Brigandi. At 11:15 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 428.64 points, or 1.72 percent, at 24,555.91, the S&P 500 was down 61.93 points, or 2.29 percent, at 2,643.64 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 215.49 points, or 2.94 percent, at 7,102.85. A clutch of weak outlooks on Wednesday pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory and erased the Dow and the S&P 500’s gains for the year. On Thursday, Microsoft Corp’s strong earnings led a rally that pulled the S&P and the Dow back into the black for 2018. Intel Corp stood out amid the carnage in technology stocks, jumping 3.1 percent after its better-than-expected quarterly results, though interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said trade tensions with China could be a “headwind” next year. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 5.72-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 4.29-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and 85 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded four new highs and 277 new lows.

The Nasdaq dropped nearly 2 percent, sharply cutting its gains for the year and moving deeper into correction territory, while the blue-chip Dow shed 1.1 percent and the benchmark S&P fell 1.56 percent, putting under threat their slim gains for the year. Amazon.com Inc tumbled 7.1 percent after it not just missed quarterly sales estimates, but also gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast. Google-parent Alphabet Inc sank 3.3 percent after its revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that investments in new businesses, rising regulatory scrutiny and competition are producing slow returns. That triggered a sell-off in other members of the so-called FAANG group. Both Facebook Inc and Netflix Inc dropped 2.3 percent and Apple Inc slid 1.5 percent. All of the 11 major S&P sectors were in the red, with the communication services taking the steepest hit with a 2.06 percent fall and technology stocks down 1.48 percent. “When the stocks that are carrying the markets begin to crack, investors are going take cover. Investors are waiting for more visibility for things to see where the rotation takes them,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. On the brighter side was data that showed gross domestic product increased at a 3.5 percent annualized rate in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partly offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory investment. “This is seen as a slight positive. There’s less pressure on the Federal Reserve to do something (on interest rates),” Bakhos said. While U.S. economic growth kept apace despite trade wars, the same cannot be said of U.S. corporate profit growth, as a slew of disappointing forecasts this earnings season showed how tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs as well as jitters over geopolitical events are hurting companies. At 9:56 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 274.85 points, or 1.10 percent, at 24,709.70, the S&P 500 was down 42.12 points, or 1.56 percent, at 2,663.45 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 144.96 points, or 1.98 percent, at 7,173.38. A clutch of weak outlook on Wednesday pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory and erased the Dow and the S&P 500’s gains for the year.

Gross domestic product increased at a 3.5 percent annualized rate in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory investment. The expansion, while slower than the previous quarter’s 4.2 percent pace beat economists’ prediction of a 3.3 percent pace and is now in its ninth year, the second longest on record. “This is seen as a slight positive. There’s less pressure on the Federal Reserve to do something (on interest rates),” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “Right now we’re seeing a slightly positive effect by the markets, since they’re not down as much, but this will be short-lived because the more important thing would be earnings of Google and Amazon.” While U.S. economic growth continues apace, despite trade wars, the same cannot be said of U.S. corporate profit growth, with a slew of disappointing forecasts this earnings season showing how tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs as well as jitters over geopolitical events are hitting companies. The latest, and perhaps most high-profile, instance came last night from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc , two of the stocks that have helped power the equity markets decade-long bull run. Amazon tumbled 7 percent premarket after it not only missed quarterly sales estimates, but also gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast. Amazon Web Services only narrowly beat estimates. Google-parent Alphabet sank 4.3 percent after its revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that investments in new businesses, rising regulatory scrutiny and competition are producing slow, unpredictable returns. That triggered a drop in other members of the so-called FAANG group. Facebook Inc fell 3.1 percent, Apple Inc slid 1.6 percent and Netflix Inc dropped 3.8 percent. “When the stocks that are carrying the markets begin to crack, investors are going take cover. Investors are waiting for more visibility for things to see where the rotation takes them,” said Bakhos. At 8:57 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 179 points, or 0.72 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 24.25 points, or 0.9 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 122.5 points, or 1.77 percent. A clutch of weak outlooks on Wednesday pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory, when an index closes 10 percent or lower than its record-high close, and erased the Dow and the S&P 500’s gains for the year. On Thursday, Microsoft Corp’s strong earnings led a rally that pulled the S&P and Dow back into the black for 2018. Microsoft, whose strong results helped push the Nasdaq to its biggest daily gain since March just a day earlier, fell 4.7 percent. Intel Corp defied the weakness to gain 2.5 percent after its better-than-expected quarterly results, though interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said trade tensions with China could be a “headwind” next year.

The Nasdaq Composite was set to cut its gains for the year in half as Nasdaq 100 e-minis sank over 2 percent. S&P 500 e-minis and Dow e-minis shed about 1 percent each, which would be enough to push both the indexes back into losses for the year. Amazon.com Inc tumbled 9.5 percent in premarket trading after it not only missed quarterly sales estimates, but also gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast. Its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, only narrowly beat estimates. Google-parent Alphabet Inc sank 6.1 percent after its revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that investments in new businesses, rising regulatory scrutiny and competition are producing slow, unpredictable returns. The reports triggered a pullback in other members of the so-called FAANG group. Facebook Inc fell 3.3 percent, Apple Inc slid 2 percent and Netflix Inc dropped 4.7 percent. A clutch of weak outlooks on Wednesday had led the Nasdaq to confirm a correction and erased the Dow and the S&P 500’s gains for the year. On Thursday, Microsoft Corp’s strong earnings led a rally that pulled the S&P and Dow back into the black for 2018. “Risk aversion is alive and kicking on Friday, as weaker than expected tech earnings trigger the latest stampede and those still buying the dips once again get burned,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda, said in a note. “Earnings season has more to run, so there’s plenty of time for companies to turn this funk around. But, as yet, they haven’t given investors the boost they well and truly need.” While investors grapple with a slowdown in the bumper corporate profit growth, they are now also faced with a scenario of U.S. economic growth also taking a breather after months of strength. U.S. GDP growth likely slowed to a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, from 4.2 percent in the prior quarter, data at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT) is expected to show. “Today’s number could give signs if we are close to peak earnings for U.S. corporates. Housing data and consumer goods durables data has been soft lately,” said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore. At 6:56 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 239 points, or 0.96 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 33 points, or 1.23 percent, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 164.75 points, or 2.38 percent. Microsoft, whose strong results helped push the Nasdaq to its biggest daily gain since March just a day earlier, fell 4.7 percent. Intel Corp was up only 0.4 percent as its better-than-expected quarterly results were clouded by interim Chief Executive Bob Swan saying trade tensions with China could be a “headwind” next year. The pullback in U.S. corporate and economic growth has heightened investors worries that a decade-old bull market may be ending and triggered a whipsaw in the market for the past few weeks. Despite Thursday’s pop, the S&P is down 7.2 percent this month, on pace for its worst month in seven years.

The wobbly start for regional bourses came despite a bounce on Wall Street overnight, which was helped by bargain-hunting and positive earnings from Microsoft Corp. Those gains were put into perspective, however, as shares of both Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc fell sharply after the closing bell on disappointing earnings. Predictably, the Nasdaq futures turned down 1 percent and S&P E-mini futures fell 0.8 percent, underscoring broad worries about U.S. corporate earnings, and the outlook for the economy, which triggered a plunge on Wall Street on Wednesday and sent global markets into a tailspin. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.69 percent, erasing tiny gains made in the opening hour. The index has been bruised by a heavy sell-off in the past several days, and is on course for its fifth weekly loss - its longest such streak since 2015. It has fallen more than 3 percent this week. Shares in China moved in and out of the black in choppy trade, with the blue-chip index down 0.39 percent and the Shanghai Composite off less than 0.1 percent. Chinese shares have been hit by volatility this week amid a string of official announcements and measures aimed at supporting the markets following a recent plunge. The heavy sell-off has raised concerns about risks posed by about $620 billion worth of shares pledged for loans. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was 0.55 percent lower, with tech shares dropping 1.9 percent. Tech firms also fell in South Korea, where the broader market fell 1.7 percent, deepening losses after the Kospi closed at its lowest level since January 2017 on Thursday. Chipmaker SK Hynix was down 1.24 percent after falling 3 percent on Thursday, and Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd was 5.58 percent lower. In Australia, shares turned down 0.31 percent after gaining modestly at the start. Japan’s Nikkei stock index also snapped back into the red after pushing up in early deals, last trading down 0.22 percent after tumbling 3.7 percent on Thursday. Financial markets have been whipsawed in recent sessions on concerns over global growth as investors fretted over Sino-U.S. trade frictions, a mixed bag of U.S. corporate earnings, Federal Reserve rate hikes and Italian budget woes. A slowdown in China has been particularly worrying for policy makers and investors, hitting asset markets from stocks to currencies and commodities. Analysts at Capital Economics sounded a cautious note, suggesting that the bounce in the S&P 500 index on Thursday was only temporary as investors worries about the economic outlook worsen. “The first, and most important (worry) is that Fed tightening and fading fiscal stimulus will cause the US economy to take a turn for the worse ... The second is that China’s economy will continue to struggle,” the analysts said in a note to clients. “As we have been arguing for a while now, these worries are likely to get worse over the next twelve months or so.” Investors will get a chance to check the U.S. economic pulse later Friday when the government releases third-quarter GDP data. ANZ analysts highlighted weak U.S. core durable goods data as suggesting that “investment is not taking off, even with the apparent tailwind from tax cuts and USD repatriation.” “This indicates that the boost to GDP growth from the fiscal stimulus could be fairly transitory,” the analysts said. In currency markets, the euro edged lower, extending weakness after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank’s 2.6 trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates could rise after next summer, despite fears about the monetary union’s economic and political future. The single currency was 0.03 percent lower at $1.1371. The dollar was off 0.11 percent against the yen at 112.29 . The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.04 percent lower at 96.636. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 3.1092 percent compared with its U.S. close of 3.136 percent on Thursday.

"(Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) fell 6 percent on Friday, cutting its market value back to less than $1 trillion after it forecast softer-than-expected sales for the holiday quarter and fueled nerves over iPhone sales by saying it would no longer release the figures. The dip in Apple’s shares to $208.50 knocked around $67 billion off its value, and put Amazon and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) back in the mix in the race among the United States’ big tech players to be the world’s most valuable company. The Cupertino, California-based company blamed weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs for a disappointing forecast for sales in the run-up to Christmas that are crucial to results for consumer electronics producers. Most analysts were still upbeat on fourth-quarter results, and there was no obvious fallout for rest of the FAANG group of major U.S. tech stocks. Shares in Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) all rose on a generally buoyant Wall Street. Eight brokerages cut their price targets for Apple, but only one - Bank of America Merrill Lynch - cut its rating on the stock, to neutral from buy. “Time for investors to adjust to the new disclosures,” analysts from the brokerage said. “Although the long term opportunity is significant, we expect near term pressure on shares.” The move announced on Thursday to stop reporting unit sales data for iPhones, iPad and Mac computer products was widely criticized, with some arguing it meant Apple expected sales of iPhones have now peaked. “While the company believes units are a less relevant metric, we strongly disagree – particularly since we believe iPhone units will begin to decline y/y as a result of higher average selling prices,” Raymond James analysts said. Apple shares were down 6.4 pct at $208.05 before the bell.

"(Repeats item with no changes to text) By Sarah White and Pascale Denis PARIS, Nov 5 (Reuters) - China’s online giants Alibaba and JD.com are taking their battle for relevance in the lucrative luxury goods market to a new level, as they aim to crack e-commerce tie-ups with top brands that usually shun selling through third parties. From Hugo Boss to La Perla underwear, the online shopping giants have recruited dozens of labels since launching their rival luxury sites in mid-2017, touting their access to a trove of consumer data and their grip on local payments systems in the world’s biggest market for high-end fashion. But some of the most prized names have so far remained aloof, and the race is on to attract the likes of LVMH’s Louis Vuitton: a brand notorious for only selling its handbags and other wares through its own stores and websites. Both are banking that even elusive outsiders will tire of trying to fly solo in China, where potential clients shop far more by mobile phone apps than in the United States or Europe, and those in smaller, far-flung cities are hard to reach. “It’s a matter of time,” said Xia Ding, the head of fashion at China’s No.2 e-commerce player JD.com and of its luxury site Toplife, adding the platform had held talks with all major brands. That echoes a similar message from its bigger competitor Alibaba and its Luxury Pavilion platform. As they chase labels, the firms are willing to go where the likes of Amazon will not. That includes giving them control over their image and prices - some of which, like $97,926 Tiffany jewels, have reached eye-watering amounts - while offering advantageous fees compared with Western equivalents. And while some brands like Italy’s independent Armani signed up early on to both sites, the platforms have since devised more elaborate deals to win over and retain others. Alibaba is developing a specific app for Chinese travellers with its most significant luxury client to date, Cartier-owner Richemont and its Net-A-Porter online shopping portal, and it teamed up with Italy’s Moncler to sell a collection of its fancy puffer jackets designed solely for Pavilion. Alibaba, behind mass market shopping sites Tmall and Taobao and YouTube equivalent Youku, has already bagged distribution or content-sharing alliances ranging from U.S. coffee behemoth Starbucks to Walt Disney. JD - which counts Tencent Holdings Ltd, owner of social media platform WeChat, as an investor - also has partnerships with the likes of Walmart and Alphabet Inc’s Google , helping it gain a foothold beyond China and Southeast Asia. In luxury, it has cracked some top brands at LVMH’s rival, Paris-based conglomerate Kering, signing Balenciaga, known for its luxury sneakers, and fashion house Saint Laurent on to Toplife. SOLO EFFORTS Vuitton, one of the market leaders in the luxury sector with annual revenues estimated at more than 9 billion euros, is fiercely protective of its distribution as a means of controlling prices and supply. That has helped Vuitton, and a handful of rivals such as Hermes, maker of $10,000-plus Birkin bags, sustain their status at the upper end of the luxury hierarchy, a high-margin sphere to which others like Britain’s Burberry aspire. In China, Vuitton - like Kering’s Gucci or Hermes - has ventured online but on its own terms, with a WeChat store and a standalone e-commerce site launched in 2017 that it says is doing well, though it does not publish earnings. “Everyone told me you couldn’t go it alone in China, that no-one went to a ‘brands.com’ and I think we’ve proven that to be incorrect,” Ian Rogers, who runs the digital operations at parent LVMH. “When you have a product people really want, they’re going to get it the way that’s possible to get it.” Chinese customers are critical for Vuitton and its peers, already accounting for at least a third of all industry sales. Many are starting to spend more at home rather than on overseas trips, encouraged by government measures such as cuts in import duties, leading labels to lower prices accordingly. But while Vuitton has stores in 20 Chinese cities, it is relying like rivals on online sales to reach clients beyond that base. “A third of potential buyers are in cities where there are no luxury stores. Their only access to products is e-commerce,” said Sebastien Badault, Alibaba’s managing director for France. The group says it can give luxury brands visibility and access to those areas, and also crunch data from its more than 600 million online shopping clients to help them identify pockets of demand. EDUCATION PROCESS LVMH did not comment on what it would take for Vuitton to join forces with either of the Chinese players. The two offer some subtly different services, with JD also handling inventories and storage for those who want it, or offering to ease brands’ set-up within WeChat, a platform with a billion users. The sites offer to share client data and take commissions per sale, which at Alibaba’s Luxury Pavilion sit at up to 5 percent, Badault said. That is in line with the broader online shopping sector in China, but lower than the 12-15 percent average on U.S. or European equivalents, he added. JD declined to give details. Other LVMH brands have already taken the plunge, including several cosmetics labels such as Benefit, which retails on Tmall. Upscale fur house Fendi has experimented with a pop-up store on JD’s Toplife - a method used by the group to lure brands in. “We’re open to doing that because we know it’s an education process,” Ding said, adding that JD had constant exchanges even with the reticent brands like Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci. “We are invited by them to give lectures, to share our findings and experience.” PEANUTS Hermes has already signalled it could cave eventually - a major departure for a brand that also only sells in its own networks. Gucci has made its red lines clear, demanding more of a crackdown on fake luxury goods circulating on the likes of Tmall. JD and Alibaba will still have to persuade brands that their platforms can deliver. They aim to eventually reach a universe of 200 to 250 luxury labels, up from the 80 Toplife expects to have by year end or the 75 Pavilion now boasts. Moncler, which launched on Pavilion in late September, said in October it was happy with the project, though the impact on sales volumes was “not yet” material. But luxury players are also increasingly open about their struggle to break China’s online market alone. “Our business is on fire and when I look at the e-commerce that we do (in China) it’s basically peanuts,” Fabrizio Cardinali, chief operating officer at Italy’s independent Dolce & Gabbana, told a Financial Times Business of Luxury conference earlier this year. “We need to find a way to break through, and it’s not just for us, it’s for everybody.” (Reporting by Sarah White and Pascale Denis; Editing by Alex Richardson)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A panel of three federal appeals court judges named by former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama will hear the Justice Department’s appeal of a ruling allowing AT&T Inc to acquire Time Warner, court records show. Judges Judith W. Rogers, Robert L. Wilkins and David B. Sentelle will hear arguments on Dec. 6. The government argues that AT&T’s $85.4 billion acquisition will lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law, while AT&T says the government offered no basis for second guessing key conclusions of a lower-court ruling allowing the transaction to proceed. Sentelle, a Reagan appointee, and Rogers, who was named to the bench by Clinton, were among seven appeals court judges in June 2001 that issued an opinion tossing out an order that Microsoft Corp should be broken up but found that the company possessed monopoly power and agreed that the company had behaved anticompetively. The company ultimately agreed to a settlement with the Justice Department and an agreement to end retaliation against computer makers who use non-Microsoft software. Wilkins, who joined the appeals court in 2014 as an Obama appointee, ruled on some antitrust matters as a judge on the U.S. District Court in Washington, including approving a consent decree that allowed Google, now known as Alphabet Inc, to acquire ITA Software in 2011. AT&T agreed in June to temporarily manage Time Warner’s Turner networks separately from DirecTV, including setting prices and managing personnel, until any appeals were resolved.

FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoFederal and state officials could still force companies to change their data practices and even pay restitution under the proposal, which Intel wrote and began talking to Congress members about this week in an unusual step for a corporation. But the protection from civil actions would constitute a major win for Silicon Valley tech companies that would come at the cost of being more forthright about how they process user data. Repeat offenders could lose protection, and executives who falsely certify their compliance could face criminal prosecution, according to the proposed legislation provided by the company. David Hoffman, Intel’s global privacy officer, told Reuters on Tuesday that executives’ fear of imprisonment would drive “the best privacy protection you can get.” Intel itself does not collect much consumer data. Big data collectors, such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, are among the top buyers of Intel’s lucrative computer server chips. Hoffman said increasing consumer privacy concerns over the last five years have lead to “pushback” on electronic health records and education data systems. “That’s all bad for our business,” he said. Marc Groman, an adjunct law professor at Georgetown University and former White House senior adviser on privacy, said Intel’s proposal should be taken seriously. He described the safe harbor from fines as reasonable and the grant of rulemaking authority to the FTC as crucial for the legislation to keep up with new technology. Data privacy has become a pressing political issue in the United States, with major technology companies Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) questioned by Congress on their practices. In Europe, a General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect in May. Breaking privacy laws in Europe can now result in fines of up to 4 percent of a firm’s global revenue. The Intel proposal caps fines at $1 billion and unlike GDPR, does not have a provision requiring companies to notify victims of data breaches. In the United States, California this year passed tough new privacy rules that tech companies say will be difficult to comply with. In September, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other companies told Congress they would support a federal law overriding California’s rules, which go into effect in 2020.

"Nov 8 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Thursday it would make changes to how it handles sexual harassment claims, a week after thousands of its employees around the world walked off their jobs to protest its response to such issues. Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai announced a detailed “action plan”, which included making arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims. "Going forward, we will provide more transparency on how we handle concerns," Pichai said in a note here addressed to employees. Pichai also said Google will provide more details around sexual harassment investigations and outcomes, as well as improving processes used to handle such concerns, including the ability for its employees to be accompanied by a support person. Google said employees will now be required to undergo sexual harassment training annually, instead of every two years currently. “We will update and expand our mandatory sexual harassment training,” Pichai said. The company also said it would publicly release its harassment, discrimination and retaliation policies. The protests at Google earlier this month followed a New York Times report that the company in 2014 gave a $90 million exit package to a senior vice president, Andy Rubin, after he was accused of sexual harassment.

"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Wednesday, as the network gear maker benefited from demand for its routers and switches as well as growth in newer areas of focus such as software. FILE PHOTO: A logo of Cisco is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File PhotoShares of the company, which also forecast second-quarter revenue largely above expectations, rose 4 percent in extended trading, putting them on track to add to a near 16 percent gain for the year. Cisco pivoted to software and cyber security to cushion the impact from slowing demand for its routers and switches from companies increasingly shifting to cloud services offered by Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc instead of building their own networks. Revenue in its application software businesses rose 18 percent to $1.42 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales in its security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 11 percent to $651 million. That fell short of the IBES estimate of $656.4 million, but beat research firm FactSet’s estimate of $648.1 million. Deals such as the $2.35 billion purchase of cyber security provider Duo Security in August have played an important part in driving growth in Cisco’s newer business. Acquisitions provided an 80-basis-point boost to the company’s first-quarter results compared with a year ago, Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Revenue in its infrastructure platform unit, which houses the switches and routers business, rose about 9 percent to $7.64 billion, topping expectation of $7.39 billion. Subscriptions, which provide a more steady revenue flow, accounted for 57 percent of total software revenue in the first quarter, the company said. The preceding quarter’s share was 56 percent. “Cisco is executing on its plan to move its business model to software and subscriptions while benefiting from a strong IT spending environment,” said Mark Cash, an analyst with Morningstar. Cisco Chief Executive Charles Robbins said in an interview that the company was impacted by the Trump administration’s 10 percent tariffs on imports from China in the first quarter. “We implemented some price increases, as we said we would, and frankly, we didn’t see any difference in the momentum before we did that and the momentum we saw after that in the quarter,” Robbins told CNBC. “Obviously, we would prefer that the tariffs don’t get increased to 25 percent in January.” Robbins also told CNBC cnb.cx/2K4QUic he is hopeful that a solution could be reached over the U.S.-China trade dispute now that U.S. midterm elections are over. The company said it expects second-quarter revenue growth of between 5 percent and 7 percent from a year earlier. This implies a range of between $12.48 billion and $12.72 billion, while analysts forecast $12.53 billion. For its first quarter ended Oct. 27, the company posted an adjusted profit of 75 cents per share, above the average estimate of 72 cents. Total revenue rose 7.7 percent to $13.07 billion, topping estimate of $12.87 billion. However, the company said deferred revenue fell 9.4 percent to $16.81 billion.

"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asia’s internet economy is expected to exceed $240 billion by 2025, a joint study by Google and Temasek Holdings showed, a fifth more than previously estimated, as more consumers use their smartphones to go online. People use their mobile phones at a university in Semenyih, outside Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia November 3, 2017. REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin The study, first published in 2016, encompasses ride-hailing, e-commerce, online travel and online media. The latest report released on Monday adds new sectors such as online food delivery, as well as subscription music and video on demand. It estimated that the gross merchandise value (GMV) of the region’s internet economy has reached $72 billion in 2018, rising 37 percent from the year earlier. The GMV of e-commerce in the region will exceed $23 billion in 2018, the report said, and rise more than four times to exceed $100 billion by 2025, helped by increased consumer trust. It credited e-commerce companies - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Lazada, Sea Ltd’s Shopee, and Indonesia’s Tokopedia - for helping develop the sector. The report estimated that the GMV of the competitive ride hailing sector, with the addition of online food delivery, has reached $7.7 billion in 2018. “Powered by the ambitions of Go-Jek and Grab to become Southeast Asia’s ‘everyday apps’, we project that ride hailing will reach almost $30 billion by 2025,” the Google-Temasek study said. Both Alphabet Inc’s Google and Singapore state investor Temasek [TEM.UL] have invested in Go-Jek. Temasek-backed Vertex Ventures is an early investor in Grab. The Indonesian internet economy is forecast to grow to $100 billion by 2025, accounting for $4 of every $10 spent in the region, the report said. It added that 2018 was on track to be a record year for fundraising for the region’s internet economy companies, with $9.1 billion raised in the first half of the year, nearly as much as in all of 2017. The research covers Southeast Asia’s six largest economies - Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The growth is being boosted by the world’s most engaged internet users, of whom more than 90 percent connect to the web through their smartphones, it said. The report said the increasing availability of affordable smartphones and the rollout of faster and more reliable mobile telecommunication services were supporting Southeast Asia’s growing internet user base.

"(Reuters) - Logitech International SA (LOGN.S), a Swiss manufacturer of keyboards and webcams, has ended discussions to acquire Plantronics Inc (PLT.N), a U.S. maker of Bluetooth earpieces and gaming headsets, the companies said on Sunday. FILE PHOTO: Chief Executive Bracken Darrell of the computer peripherals maker Logitech addresses the company's annual news conference in Zurich, Switzerland April 26, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannThe announcement came after Reuters reported on the negotiations between Logitech and Plantronics last Friday. The companies confirmed the talks on Sunday, but said they had now been terminated. Plantronics added in its statement that Logitech approached it regarding a potential acquisition, and that it engaged in discussions in line with its fiduciary duties. It said it would deliver on its strategy as a stand-alone company. “I have been and remain tremendously optimistic about the opportunity in front of us, and with our focused strategy and leadership team, I am confident that Plantronics will create significant long term value for shareholders,” Plantronics Chief Executive Joe Burton said in the statement. Logitech and Plantronics were hoping to successfully conclude negotiations this week, but Logitech’s board decided on Sunday to walk away from the potential deal, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential discussions. Logitech’s board ended negotiations over price disagreements, according to a source close to the company. That was despite Plantronics having opened its books to Logitech on the basis of an offer by Logitech that was well in excess of $3 billion, three of the sources added. Plantronics had a market capitalization of about $2 billion as of the end of trading on Friday. The deal would have been by far Logitech’s largest acquisition, amid a push to diversify its business beyond computer peripherals. It would have come as Logitech and Plantronics seek to keep down manufacturing costs following the introduction of tariffs on imports from China into the United States. Logitech’s and Plantronics’ businesses have been under pressure as a result of new offerings being developed, not just from network gear makers such as Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), but from major technology companies such as Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) and Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). Founded in 1981, Logitech has been countering declining sales of personal computers by focusing on consumer accessories that are benefiting from the growth of cloud computing, such as gaming, music, smart home connectivity and video conferencing. The Lausanne-based company has a market capitalization of $5.6 billion. Last year, Logitech acquired ASTRO Gaming for $85 million in cash to expand in the video game sector. Santa Cruz, California-based Plantronics makes unified communications systems, wireless headsets, conferencing systems, and some software, which it sells to businesses and consumers. Founded in 1961, Plantronics’ first products were lightweight headsets for airline pilots. It later became known for selling headsets to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, including the ones worn by Neil Armstrong during his first moonwalk in 1969. A sale of Plantronics would have come on the heels of the company’s $2 billion acquisition in July of U.S. video-conferencing equipment maker Polycom Inc. Reporting by Liana B.

"Nov 27 (Reuters) - Eleven employees comprising engineers and managers at Alphabet Inc’s Google published an open letter on Tuesday, demanding that the company end development of a censored search engine for Chinese users, escalating earlier protests against the secretive project. Google has described the search app, known as Project Dragonfly, as an experiment not close to launching. But as details of it have leaked since August, current and former employees, human rights activists and U.S. lawmakers have criticized Google for not taking a harder line against the Chinese government’s policy that politically sensitive results be blocked. Human rights group Amnesty International also launched a public petition on Tuesday calling on Google to cancel Dragonfly. The organization said it would encourage Google workers to sign the petition by targeting them on LinkedIn and protesting outside Google offices. About 1,400 of Google’s tens of thousands of workers urged the company in August to improve oversight of ethically questionable ventures, including Dragonfly. Google has long sought to have a bigger presence in China, the world’s largest internet market. It needs government approval to compete with the country’s dominant homegrown internet services. The employees who signed their names on Tuesday’s letter said they had seen little progress, and expect more colleagues to publicly back the push to cancel Dragonfly. The letter expresses concern about the Chinese government tracking dissidents through search data and suppressing truth through content restrictions. “We object to technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be,” the employees said in the letter published on blogging service Medium. The employees said they no longer believe Google is “a company willing to place its values over profits,” and cited a string of “disappointments” this year, including acknowledgement of a big payout to an executive who had been accused of sexual harassment. That incident sparked global protests at Google, which like other big technology companies has seen an uptick in employee activism during the last two years as their services become an integral part of civic infrastructure. Google was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by Paresh Dave in San Francisco Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Tap out "I love" and Gmail might propose "you" or "it.""	"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Paresh Dave SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google in May introduced a slick feature for Gmail that automatically completes sentences for users as they type. Tap out “I love” and Gmail might propose “you” or “it.” But users are out of luck if the object of their affection is “him” or “her.” Google’s technology will not suggest gender-based pronouns because the risk is too high that its “Smart Compose” technology might predict someone’s sex or gender identity incorrectly and offend users, product leaders revealed to Reuters in interviews. Gmail product manager Paul Lambert said a company research scientist discovered the problem in January when he typed “I am meeting an investor next week,” and Smart Compose suggested a possible follow-up question: “Do you want to meet him?” instead of “her.” Consumers have become accustomed to embarrassing gaffes from autocorrect on smartphones. But Google refused to take chances at a time when gender issues are reshaping politics and society, and critics are scrutinizing potential biases in artificial intelligence like never before. “Not all ‘screw ups’ are equal,” Lambert said. Gender is a “a big, big thing” to get wrong. Getting Smart Compose right could be good for business. Demonstrating that Google understands the nuances of AI better than competitors is part of the company’s strategy to build affinity for its brand and attract customers to its AI-powered cloud computing tools, advertising services and hardware. Gmail has 1.5 billion users, and Lambert said Smart Compose assists on 11 percent of messages worldwide sent from Gmail.com, where the feature first launched. Smart Compose is an example of what AI developers call natural language generation (NLG), in which computers learn to write sentences by studying patterns and relationships between words in literature, emails and web pages. A system shown billions of human sentences becomes adept at completing common phrases but is limited by generalities. Men have long dominated fields such as finance and science, for example, so the technology would conclude from the data that an investor or engineer is “he” or “him.” The issue trips up nearly every major tech company. Lambert said the Smart Compose team of about 15 engineers and designers tried several workarounds, but none proved bias-free or worthwhile. They decided the best solution was the strictest one: Limit coverage. The gendered pronoun ban affects fewer than 1 percent of cases where Smart Compose would propose something, Lambert said. “The only reliable technique we have is to be conservative,” said Prabhakar Raghavan, who oversaw engineering of Gmail and other services until a recent promotion. NEW POLICY Google’s decision to play it safe on gender follows some high-profile embarrassments for the company’s predictive technologies. The company apologized in 2015 when the image recognition feature of its photo service labeled a black couple as gorillas. In 2016, Google altered its search engine’s autocomplete function after it suggested the anti-Semitic query “are jews evil” when users sought information about Jews. Google has banned expletives and racial slurs from its predictive technologies, as well as mentions of its business rivals or tragic events. The company’s new policy banning gendered pronouns also affected the list of possible responses in Google’s Smart Reply. That service allow users to respond instantly to text messages and emails with short phrases such as “sounds good.” Google uses tests developed by its AI ethics team to uncover new biases. A spam and abuse team pokes at systems, trying to find “juicy” gaffes by thinking as hackers or journalists might, Lambert said. Workers outside the United States look for local cultural issues. Smart Compose will soon work in four other languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French. “You need a lot of human oversight,” said engineering leader Raghavan, because “in each language, the net of inappropriateness has to cover something different.” WIDESPREAD CHALLENGE Google is not the only tech company wrestling with the gender-based pronoun problem. Agolo, a New York startup that has received investment from Thomson Reuters, uses AI to summarize business documents. Its technology cannot reliably determine in some documents which pronoun goes with which name. So the summary pulls several sentences to give users more context, said Mohamed AlTantawy, Agolo’s chief technology officer. He said longer copy is better than missing details. “The smallest mistakes will make people lose confidence,” AlTantawy said. “People want 100 percent correct.” Yet, imperfections remain. Predictive keyboard tools developed by Google and Apple Inc propose the gendered “policeman” to complete “police” and “salesman” for “sales.” Type the neutral Turkish phrase “one is a soldier” into Google Translate and it spits out “he’s a soldier” in English. So do translation tools from Alibaba and Microsoft Corp . Amazon.com Inc opts for “she” for the same phrase on its translation service for cloud computing customers. AI experts have called on the companies to display a disclaimer and multiple possible translations. Microsoft’s LinkedIn said it avoids gendered pronouns in its year-old predictive messaging tool, Smart Replies, to ward off potential blunders. Alibaba and Amazon did not respond to requests to comment. Warnings and limitations like those in Smart Compose remain the most-used countermeasures in complex systems, said John Hegele, integration engineer at Durham, North Carolina-based Automated Insights Inc, which generates news articles from statistics. “The end goal is a fully machine-generated system where it magically knows what to write,” Hegele said. “There’s been a ton of advances made but we’re not there yet.” (Reporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Marla Dickerson)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Jason LeePichai in September had agreed to testify at a future date before the panel over Republican concerns that the company is biased against conservatives after it skipped a high-profile Senate hearing. Google has denied it is biased toward conservatives. Google confirmed on Wednesday that Pichai will testify. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, noted that the company accounts for nearly 90 percent of worldwide search traffic. “Its business practices may have been affected by political bias,” McCarthy said. “For months, House Republicans have called for greater transparency and openness from Google.... Mr. Pichai’s scheduled appearance in front of the House Judiciary Committee is another important step to restoring public trust in Google and all the companies that shape the Internet.” McCarthy also said Congress wants to review Google’s potential new investments in China. Google previously told U.S. lawmakers it was considering “a variety of options” to offer additional services in China, but declined to detail plans for addressing Chinese censorship. The company has come under criticism after reports it was considering re-entering China’s search engine market and would comply with its internet censorship and surveillance policies. On Tuesday, more than 200 Google engineers, designers and managers demanded in an open letter that the company end development of a censored search engine for Chinese users, escalating earlier protests against the project. In September, a bipartisan group of 16 U.S. House lawmakers asked Google to disclose precautions it would take to protect the safety of its users if Chinese regulators allow its search engine to operate. Pichai may also face questions about why it delayed disclosing vulnerabilities with its Google+ social network. The company has received inquiries from Congress over the issue.

"(Reuters) - Amazon.com on Wednesday launched a microchip aimed at so-called machine learning, entering a market that both Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp are counting on to boost their earnings in the coming years. The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018. REUTERS/Pascal RossignolAmazon is one of the largest buyers of chips from Intel and Nvidia, whose semiconductors help power Amazon’s booming cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. But Amazon has started to design its own chips. Amazon’s so-called “Inferentia” chip announced on Wednesday will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests. The Amazon chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia’s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer. Intel’s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. [nL1N1V801B] In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel. In addition to its machine learning chip, Amazon on Monday announced a processor chip for its cloud unit called Graviton. That chip is powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Arm-based chips currently power mobile phones, but multiple companies are trying to make them suitable for data centers. [nL2N1W402B] The use of Arm chips in data centers potentially represents a major challenge to Intel’s dominance in that market. Amazon is not alone among cloud computing vendors in designing its own chips. Alphabet Inc-owned Google’s cloud unit in 2016 unveiled an artificial intelligence chip designed to take on chips from Nvidia. Custom chips can be expensive to design and produce, and analysts have pointed to such investment driving up research and capital expenses for big tech companies. Google Cloud executives have said customer demand for Google’s custom chip, the TPU, has been strong. But the chips can be costly to use and require software customization. Google Cloud charges $8 per hour of access to its TPU chips and as much as $2.48 per hour in the United States for access to Nvidia’s chips, according to Google’s website.

"FILE PHOTO: A Gojek driver rides his motorcycle through a business district street in Jakarta, June 9, 2015. . REUTERS/BeawihartaSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek kicked off a trial launch in parts of Singapore on Thursday and plans to roll out an array of services through its app in early 2019, challenging dominant player Grab in the small city-state. Both Go-Jek and Grab are raising billions of dollars and investing aggressively in the race to corner a bigger share of Southeast Asia, as more of the region’s 640 million consumers go online and use smartphones to shop, commute and make payments. Go-Jek, backed by the likes of Tencent Holdings, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, is initially launching ride-hailing service in parts of Singapore after forming a partnership with DBS Group Holdings, the region’s biggest bank. “As this is a new product, we will obviously give promotions, but at the end of the day it shouldn’t only be pricing that differentiates our services,” Go-Jek’s president, Andre Soelistyo, told reporters on Thursday. Grab, backed by Japan’s SoftBank and Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing, bought Uber Technologies’ loss-making Southeast Asian business this year, marking the first big consolidation in the region. Following this, Singapore’s anti-trust watchdog slapped Grab and Uber with fines and imposed measures to open up the local market to competitors after concluding that their merger had driven up prices. Go-Jek’s executives declined to give any details on how many drivers it had signed up or a target for market share in Singapore, but said payment services would be launched later. Started in 2011 in Jakarta, Go-Jek has evolved from a ride-hailing service to a one-stop app through which its customers can make online payments and order everything from food, groceries to massages.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have asked Google’s rivals if the internet search giant unfairly demotes local search competitors, according to a questionnaire seen by Reuters, a move which could lead to a fourth case against the Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit. FILE PHOTO: A Google logo is seen at the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., November 1, 2018. REUTERS/ Stephen Lam/File PhotoGoogle has been fined a total 6.76 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in the last 17 months for favoring its comparison shopping service and for using its dominant Android mobile operating system to reinforce its search engine market power. The European Commission, which took the world’s most popular internet search engine to task for these two anti-competitive practices, is wrapping up a third case which involves Google’s AdSense advertising service. The EU competition authority’s interest in local search services followed a complaint by U.S. search and advertising company Yelp (YELP.N) and rivals in the travel, restaurant and accommodation industries. It sent questionnaires to Google rivals last month, asking for details of the company’s practices and the impact on competing services between January 2012 to December 2017. Regulators also wanted to know if rivals experienced an impact in the operation of their local services as a result of major search algorithm changes by Google, including the introduction of its Panda 4.0 algorithm. Introduced in 2014, this algorithm determines what appears in Google search results. Companies were also asked if Google’s introduction of the Local Universal or One Box had a substantial impact on their local search services. Local Universal is targeted at hotel ads while One Box, which is information and images outlined in a box, is a tool for local businesses to get more visibility in Google search results. The Commission asked if Google used content from rival local search services such as reviews on Local Universal or One Box. Google had no immediate comment.

Alphabet's  Waymo on Wednesday launched a significant development in its costly, decade-long quest for autonomous transportation: self-driving taxis that actually generate fares. | Video "	"CHANDLER, Ariz. (Reuters) - Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Waymo on Wednesday launched a significant development in its costly, decade-long quest for autonomous transportation: self-driving taxis that actually generate fares. With little fanfare, the company has begun charging passengers to use its driverless vehicles in a roughly 100-mile (160 km) zone in four Phoenix suburbs - Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert - where it has been testing its technology since 2016. Producing revenue is a strategic milestone, putting Waymo ahead of U.S. rivals, primarily General Motors Co’s (GM.N) Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], which have yet to launch their own paid self-driving services. All are racing to win customers and recoup billions spent developing the technology. To use Waymo’s service, dubbed Waymo One, riders must download an app and provide a credit card number, similar to ridesharing services Uber and Lyft. A human driver will be behind the wheel, but only to intervene in case of emergency. Major challenges remain, starting with technical hurdles. A Waymo One taxi tested by Reuters last week proved slow and jerky at times. Whether customers will continue using the service once the novelty wears off remains to be seen. Regulations governing the industry across the country are an incoherent patchwork, a significant hurdle to fast expansion. Waymo would not say exactly how many of its cars would be on the road in Arizona. It said its around-the-clock service initially would be limited to “hundreds” of people invited to sign up last year. For now, pricing is roughly in line with that of Uber and Lyft. A 15-minute, 3-mile (4.8 km) drive taken by Reuters last week cost $7.59, just above the $7.22 offered by Lyft. “Over time, we hope to make Waymo One available to even more members of the public,” Chief Executive John Krafcik wrote in a blog on Wednesday. “Self-driving technology is new to many, so we’re proceeding carefully.” Related CoverageHow Waymo compares to U.S. rivals in the race for robotaxisThe company has been testing its driverless cars for a decade. Its fleet, now numbering 600 vehicles, has logged more than 10 million miles on public roads in and around 25 U.S. cities. Alphabet does not disclose its total investment, but industry experts put that sum at well over $1 billion. Monetizing driverless technology has been slow going. A handful of startups, including Boston-based Optimus Ride, have managed to win contracts providing self-driving services in enclosed, low-speed environments such as business parks and retirement communities. Launching taxi service on the streets of metro Phoenix underscores Waymo’s big ambitions, said Ryan Chin, co-founder and chief executive of Optimus Ride. “If you’re going to invest that much capital and time and engineering, you have to go for these larger robotaxi markets,” Chin said. “You may start in the smaller markets but the bigger goal is to go for the big fish.” Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s global head of development, said Waymo’s move puts pressure on all robotaxi hopefuls to move quickly to grab market share before others enter the game. That strategy has been key in ridesharing, where first movers such as San Francisco-based Uber and China’s Didi Chuxing have proven tough to dislodge in many cities where they operate. Driverless vehicles are the next step in the race to shape urban mobility. “Waymo is now accelerating ... because if they wait two or three years longer they will get overtaken,” Froehlich said on the sidelines of last week’s Los Angeles auto show. “So they have to move early, even though that’s quite a risky thing for them.” Three of the fleet of 600 Waymo Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid self-driving vehicles are parked and displayed during a demonstration in Chandler, Arizona, November 29, 2018. REUTERS/Caitlin O’Hara“GOOD AFTERNOON, WAYMO RIDER” Waymo invited Reuters to ride in a white Chrysler Pacifica hybrid modified with the company’s technology through the streets of Chandler, Ariz., a city about 22 miles (35 km) southeast of Phoenix. A dome-shaped sensor atop the car was the primary clue that this was no ordinary vehicle. Inside, a safety driver sat at the wheel, with a Waymo representative in the front passenger seat. Two video screens built into the seatbacks, facing the backseat passengers, read “Good afternoon, Waymo Rider.” The monitors showed the car’s trajectory, and contained touchscreen buttons that could be tapped to summon an outside Waymo operator with any questions. The drive took place on city streets with moderate traffic on wide, well-paved roads on a relatively clear day. But even in these favorable conditions, Waymo’s technology performed much like a student driver: slow and timid. The vehicle was hyper-aware of pedestrians and had trouble distinguishing their intentions. For example, it stopped for a man standing at a crosswalk talking on his cellphone even though it was clear that he was not going to cross the street. The car slowed well ahead of stop signs and drove at a snail’s pace over speed bumps. Yet it sometimes executed lane changes with an unsettling jerk as an automated voice over the speaker system called out “left” or “right.” That is a feature Waymo says helps riders understand what the car is doing. Other maneuvers came off without a hitch, including one of the trickiest: crossing three lanes of oncoming traffic to execute a left turn into a parking lot. The safety driver never touched the wheel during the entire drive. Waymo says it will phase out these human minders eventually, but has given no timeline for doing so. Slideshow (11 Images)Navigating an uncertain U.S. regulatory environment could prove even more challenging. Arizona has fewer regulations on self-driving cars than most states, a major factor in Waymo’s decision to launch there. The rest of the country is a jumble of sometimes contradictory requirements. Federal guidance has yet to arrive. A bill that would speed the use of self-driving cars without human controls has been stalled in the U.S. Senate for over a year. Meanwhile, rules on key issues such as data, privacy, liability and cyber security are still undecided. For now, Waymo says it is focused on the Phoenix area, where it hopes to gain valuable insights into supply and demand, as it awaits decisions from regulators.

But apparent bargains could turn out to be expensive if earnings expectations take a turn for the worse next year as the United States continues its trade dispute with China. Since Apple’s November forecast for a weaker-than-expected holiday shopping quarter and other reports of sluggish demand for iPhones, analysts have cut estimates for the Cupertino, California-based company’s December-quarter net income by almost $1 billion. Apple’s stock last week traded at a nearly two-year low of 13 times expected earnings, even after accounting for analysts’ reduced expectations. Already, the so-called FANG group of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet shares has seen its weight within the S&P 500 dwindle to 8 percent from as much as 10 percent in July, with investors fleeing what for years was Wall Street’s most popular trade. Since the U.S. stock market abruptly dropped in early October, Apple has lost a quarter of its value, and last week it relinquished its title as Wall Street’s most valuable company to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Since then, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon have been battling to be No. 1. Netflix has slumped 20 percent since early October, while Facebook and Amazon are both down over 10 percent. Alphabet, the least badly performing of the group, has lost 9 percent, a little worse than the S&P 500’s 8 percent decline. Investors in recent months have become increasingly worried that an ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict may hobble U.S. multinationals just as a year-long an surge in earnings growth caused by new corporate tax cuts is set to end. Tech investors have also become more concerned about a global smartphone market that is losing steam, but the resulting drop in Apple’s stock has outpaced analysts’ reduced earnings expectations. Apple and other big tech names are trading at the lowest multiples of their prices to expected earnings in years, suggesting recent selling might be overdone. “There are some attractive buying opportunities,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “We are buying Microsoft, and we could add some Apple and some Alphabet at these levels.” Facebook, plagued for months by criticism of its use of people’s personal data and fears that it could face more regulation, recently traded at 19 times expected earnings, its lowest ever. That compares to a multiple of 45 times after Facebook went public in 2012. Amazon’s stock is now trading at 64 times expected earnings, it lowest multiple since 2012. Netflix’s price/earnings multiple has dropped to 68, its lowest since 2015. Newly enacted corporate tax cuts supercharged U.S. earnings this year, but their effect on profit growth will end in the December quarter, leading analysts on average to predict S&P 500 earnings per share next year will rise 8 percent, compared to 24 percent in 2018, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “The question going into 2019 is, ‘Are you seeing enough of a pullback in those sectors that led that would entice investors to accept the lower valuations as an opportunity?’” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

FILE PHOTO: Trading information for KKR & Co is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., August 23, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoSeven weeks after KKR upped its indicative bid for the struggling Australian company to access its financial records, it wiped 10 percent from the price it had suggested paying, MYOB said in a statement on Thursday. MYOB said it would reject an offer at the new suggested price of A$3.40 per share, from A$3.77 on Nov. 2. KKR first approached the company in October with a proposal to buy the 80 percent it did not already own for A$3.70. Since then, shares of global technology players like Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have fallen sharply amid concerns about incursions on privacy, sparking a sell-down across the broader sector. The Australian sharemarket has meanwhile tumbled 10 percent as a result of U.S.-China trade tensions. And credit markets have raised the price of corporate debt amid expectations of a rate hike, making it more expensive for firms like KKR to carry out leveraged buyouts. On Thursday MYOB shares were down 11 percent by midsession, just above the level they last traded at before KKR made its initial approach, while the broader market was down 0.2 percent. “It might be opportunism based on that move down in tech shares,” CMC Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy said. “The reality is, when you make a takeover bid you see a lot of value above and beyond the price you bid at.” A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment, while a MYOB spokesman declined to comment further than the market filing announcing the lower offer. MYOB would be one of KKR’s biggest acquisitions in Australia and add to its 10-strong stable of technology businesses in the Asia-Pacific region. Although MYOB was once the dominant provider of accounting software to small and medium-sized businesses in Australia, in recent years it has struggled to compete for market share with cloud-based New Zealand rival Xero Ltd (XRO.AX). Xero has a market value three times the size of MYOB’s and offices in London, San Francisco and Denver, while MYOB operates only in Australia and New Zealand.

"12-21-2018"	"Apple changes how it reports U.S. national security requests "	"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-security/apple-changes-how-it-reports-u-s-national-security-requests-idUSKCN1OJ2R0"	"Apple Inc  on Thursday changed how it reports on U.S. national security requests for user data, bringing its procedures more in line with those of technology rivals such as Microsoft Corp  and Alphabet Inc's  Google."	"FILE PHOTO: The various colors of newly released Apple iPhone XR are seen following the product launch event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2018. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday changed how it reports on U.S. national security requests for user data, bringing its procedures more in line with those of technology rivals such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google. In its first-half 2018 transparency report on government data requests to its website, Apple separated out National Security Letters and requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Apple had combined numbers for the two items since it began reporting them in 2014. Apple had previously published its aggregate number sooner than other technology companies that broke them out separately because the FISA numbers are subject to a six-month reporting delay by law. Apple will also report the number of FISA requests for a user’s content versus those not inquiring about such content. The changes will mean longer delays in Apple’s reporting of overall national security requests. But the new format is similar to those for companies such as Microsoft and Google, making it easier for researchers and the public to compare. From January through June, Apple received 0 to 499 National Security Letters, which function somewhat like subpoenas, related to 1,000 to 1,499 users, the company said. Because of the reporting changes, Apple did not cite the number of FISA requests received for the first half of 2018 but will do so after Dec. 31. Apple on Thursday also changed the way it presents data on government requests, launching an interactive website that makes it easier for consumers to look up government data requests in their home country. It also offered the raw data in a format that makes it easier for researchers to upload into software programs. Apple said it received 4,177 “account requests” from the government related to 40,641 users. Law enforcement officials can seek information such as stored photos, email, device backups that might include text messages, contacts or calendars. Earlier this year, Apple said it was streamlining the online tools it offers for law enforcement officials to request data and would offer training courses on what kind of data officials can obtain from the iPhone maker.
